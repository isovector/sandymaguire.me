Hip hop is a surprisingly wide genre. Therefore, it shouldn't be a surprise that
different sub-genres of hip hop will appeal to different people. Traditionally,
there are a few primary facets of rap music worth paying attention to. These are
the *beats*, the *lyricism* and the *flow*.

The *beats* are the backing instrumentals. Hip hop is different from most other
genres of music in that it generally has very simple backing. It is not uncommon
for a beat to be a few bars sampled from a completely different genre (funk is a
popular one, though!)

The *lyricism* is a little harder to define, but corresponds both to how
clever the lyrics are, and to the rhyme scheme

As you work your way through the following tracks, try to pay attention to the
beats, lyricism and flow of each. It is likely that one of the three will speak
to you more than the others. You will likely notice a correlation between the
tracks you like and those that more heavily feature your favored aspect.
