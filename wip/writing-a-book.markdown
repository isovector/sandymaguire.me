I've recently been approached by a publisher to write a book riffing on the theme
of my [first book][twt]. I replied describing their offer as insulting and
exploitative, and thought I'd write a little blog post about the mechanics
behind how I got my book published and behind the relevant finances of such an
endeavor. The hope is to demystify the experience, and hopefully give other
would-be authors for this publisher some bargaining chips.

## Getting an Idea

## Knowing the Market

## Writing

Thinking with Types is roughly 34,000 words of prose and 3,277 lines of example
code. It was 144 days from creating the git repo to publishing the book

## Post-Production

## Finances

---it was \$1000 in an "advance" (0% of it is actually on signing),
and then 4% of royalties.
