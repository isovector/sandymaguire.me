I've recently been approached by a publisher to write a book riffing on the theme
of my [first book][twt]. I replied describing their offer as insulting and
exploitative, and thought I'd write a little blog post about the mechanics
behind how I got my book published and behind the relevant finances of such an
endeavor. The hope is to demystify the experience, and hopefully give other
would-be authors for this publisher some bargaining chips.

## Getting an Idea

## Knowing the Market

The State of Haskell survey came out suggesting there are somewhere between
1,335 and 5,096 people actively involved in the language.

This feels about right---#haskell on FP chat has 3,107 members, and there
averages about 1200 people on freenode #haskell at a given time.

That being said, /r/haskell has 37,000 members

## Writing

Thinking with Types is roughly 34,000 words of prose and 3,277 lines of example
code. It was 144 days from creating the git repo to publishing the book, and
took about 221 units of work (commits.)

## Post-Production

## Finances

At time of writing, I've sold about 700 copies of the book in various formats.
In total, I've made roughly \$17,500 in sales.

There were 77 patreon donors, averaging about \$800 per month for five months,
which is another \$4,000.


---it was \$1000 in an "advance" (0% of it is actually on signing),
and then 4% of royalties.
