I beat the odds this month.

After dedicating half a year of writing, I self-published my [first
book][thinking].  As far as topics go, it's pretty niche. It focuses on how to
use advanced mathematics in order to write strict computer programs. You can
imagine how disappointed people are when I tell them about it at parties. They
go pretty quickly from "You're writing a book? Cool! What's it about?" to
backing away as fast as they can.

[According to a random Guardian article that I found][guardian], the median
self-published book earns less than \$500, and the average makes about \$10,000.
My sales are significantly better than that. Somehow, despite being a first-time
author and writing a book in a [programming language that only 1200 people in
the world use][state], on a topic that makes almost everyone recoil in horror,
I've managed to do dramatically better than the majority of self-publishers.

Somehow, armed only with knowledge of the subject matter, despite not knowing
anything about editing, publishing, design or marketing, I managed to pull off a
minor hit with rave reviews. I beat the odds. And because I'd like to continue
beating them, I think this is an accomplishment worth studying.

My friend Matt recently told me about his experience at an environmentalist
meetup. Their icebreaker question to get everyone loosened up was "what activity
do you do to feel better when you feel there is no hope?"

Reasoning by the odds I don't think is a very good strategy if you're in a
position to be able to do it. The odds describe the chance of success for a
*random person,* but if you're worrying about whether or not you're falling
victim to Dunning--Kruger, **you are not a random person.**

By my account, the vast majority of exceptionally-high-performing people I know
all fall victim to impostor syndrome---the feeling that they're hack frauds, and
that any moment they're going to be uncovered.

I felt the same way when I wrote this book. "Who am I to write a definitive
textbook?"

But what I've learned is that all the scary things around writing the book---the
editing, the cover design, the marketing---all that stuff is *way easier* than
learning all of the stuff I wrote this book about. When you start analyzing the
world in terms of "wow, I could do that job," you get a better perspective for
how low the bar really is on competency.

Most people are only *OK* at their jobs, yet they haven't been fired. And their
jobs are way easier than yours.





The world is being run by people who are merely OK at their jobs. At jobs that
you would find laughably easy. Take a moment to reflect on that. That inadequacy
that you feel in your day job at Google, well, remember that Google only hires
0.5% of the people who apply. It's harder than getting into Harvard. Maybe you
don't feel particularly bright next to your peers, but the odds are that they
feel the same way next to you. And you're each capable of being a 10,000x
employee in almost any other sector.

My point is that success isn't particularly hard to achieve. At first glance,
the odds of success are not in your favor, until you realize that if you're
smart enough to be analyzing the odds, then they probably don't apply to you.

The odds are good for reasoning behind the veil of ignorance; if you randomly
meet someone on the street in Wichita who asks if you want to invest in their
new company, the odds against new startups will serve you well. But if Elon Musk
asks, well, maybe you should take into consideration the fact that he's fricken
Elon Musk. He's got a pretty sweet track record.

But here's the rub---this exact same line of reasoning applies to you too. If
you're reading this, you've probably got a pretty sweet track record yourself.
It would be downright foolish to ignore that evidence in the face of new
challenges.

I have another anecdote I'd like to share. In lieu of writing a thesis, to
graduate with an engineering degree at university, you had to do what was known
as a Forth Year Design Project (FYDP). The idea was to build something
practical, using all of our fancy new engineering know-how. You'd graduate
pretty much regardless of what you made. However, during the mandatory poster
session, representatives from Yelp were surreptitiously hanging around, and
offering cash and jobs to their favorite three projects.

There were about 30 FYDPs at the poster session, each composed of roughly four
members. Most of them felt pretty phoned-in---things like "software to help make
a podcast" and "what food is near me right now?" Perhaps this is unfair and
unkind of me, but I've always thought that these projects were the results of
people just going through the motions in order to graduate.

Three projects stood out, and unsurprisingly, were the projects that won money
and job offers. These distinguished projects weren't composed of the strong
individuals in the program. The projects varied in scope, domain and audience,
but all three had something in common: at least one of their constituent members
*deeply cared* about the project. This was not an impression I got from the
other FYDPs.

Perhaps it was a fluke, but I learned something that day---caring goes a long
way. Despite the fact that everyone in that room was exceptionally talented, the
projects built with passion were the ones that stood out. In the immortal words
of Buck 65:

> You treat each shoe like it's special
> Care about your work, and be a professional
> There's a right way to go about your job and a wrong one
> I find this way is much better in the long run
> It ain't about the dollar or trying to go fast
> Unless you take pride in what you're doing, it won't last
> Craftsmanship is a quality that some lack
>
> Buck 65, Craftsmanship

"Unless you take pride in what you're doing, it won't last." I don't know about
you, but that resonates strongly with me. When was the last time you felt pride
in something you did at work, or in something you built? In a straw-poll I just
ran on Facebook, job satisfaction correlated strongly with frequency of sources
of pride.

Its to this craftsmanship that I attribute the success of my book. Many of the
steps---editing, designing, marketing---didn't come naturally, but I just sat
down and fought with them for hours on end until I was proud of the result. It's
not magic; it's just hard work and an unwillingness to do anything with less
than excellence.
