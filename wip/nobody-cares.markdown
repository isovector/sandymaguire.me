I've got a controversial claim to make today.

The reason that climate change hasn't been solved is that *nobody really cares
about it.* Before getting out the pitchforks and accusing me of heresy, I do
actually have an argument here.

I know maybe 100 people who "really care about the environment." What this seems
to mean in practice is that they eat organic, try to cut down on using plastic,
gregariously sort out their recycling, and buy relatively-low emission vehicles.
If they're particularly virtuous, they might even regularly donate a small sum
of money to the WWF.

This is all laudable, and assuming they never take any flights, probably reduces
these people's carbon footprint by an order of magnitude. They're likely under
the individual budget of 10.5 Gt C02 necessary to keep global warming below
2&deg;C. These people are cooperating in the global prisoners dilemma, and, as
such, are doing their part. In all sincerity, this is a fantastic job, and
anyone who has committed to this level of work should be recognized and thanked.

Of these 100 people that I know, roughly ten actively go to "environmental
things" and explicitly try to engage with the sustainability community. Some of
these ten regularly volunteer for environmental causes. That's pretty great too,
but you'll notice the numbers for engagement are dropping off pretty quickly.

Not one person I know---let alone anyone I can Google---is *dedicating their
life* to this cause.
