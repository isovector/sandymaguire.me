I had a profound experience the other day. In preparation for the new year, I've
been doing a lot of thinking, and as an exercise I asked myself a question.

"What do I want my life to look like?"

Without missing a beat, the answer came to me.

"Not like this."

Damn. That's one hell of a bomb to drop on yourself, but it rang true. As we
know, the truth is a gift to always be accepted graciously, and so it was time
to face the music. The first step to fixing a problem is to admit that there's a
problem.

After very little soul searching -- apparently I already knew the answer -- I
realized with what I was dissatisfied. For as long as I can remember, my biggest
fear has been [complacency][murder]. Complacency is the culprit who will kill
your potential without your noticing. It's an duplicitous beast that rides under
the guise of "comfort." It's a life lived *pleasantly* but not *satisfactorily*.

I found myself with waning health, caused by working a job full of external and
artificial stresses. A job that I liked, but didn't *love*. A job that paid in
money and experience, though neither of which were things I actually needed.
I've got enough money, and I've got more than enough experience. A job that
sucked enough of my energy that I wasn't capable of creating the things I wanted
to be creating in the negative space around office hours.

And so what was the point? I found myself working to acquire resources I didn't
need at the expense of ones I did. It reminded me of a quote that my friend
recently shared with me:

> "Man surprised me most about humanity. Because he sacrifices his health in
> order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And
> then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the
> result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as
> if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived."
>
> -James J. Lachard

Damn. Mull that thought over for a second. I'll bet it rings uncomfortably close
to home, doesn't it? It certainly did for me.

I don't want to die having never really lived. Guess I'd better do something
about it. And that's about as good of a segue into my goals for 2018 as there
will ever be!

If there's one weird habit I have, it's doing math recreationally. If there are
two weird habits I have, it's doing math recreationally and putting taglines on
years. These are little phrases to remind me of what I'm supposed to be focusing
on during the year.

2013 was the year of doing something with my life. 2014: the year of building
infrastructure. 2015 was about consolidating power. You get the picture.

2018 is the year of *perpetual motion*.

What I mean by that is that I want to spend 100% of my time working on the
things I want to be working on. I want to be always [moving towards the
goal][moving].

[moving]: http://mindingourway.com/moving-towards-the-goal/

What all of this cashes out as is a few core pillars of fundamentals I feel like
I am missing or at which I am not yet good enough. These sub-goals are ambitious
as all-get-out, and there is no way in hell I'm going to be able to accomplish
them given my current levels of operation. My only chance is to induce an
extreme shift in lifestyle. The pillars and their components are the tactics;
the lifestyle is the desired result.


## Producing Cool Things

I have a role model. His name is Piero Scaruffi. In the internet jargon of
today: this guy fucks. [Holden Karnofsky][holden], via [Luke Muehlhauser][luke],
on Scaruffi:

See what I mean? This dude is prolific. This dude is the dude I aspire to be.

So I'm going to make it happen. Along these lines, here are the quantifiable
things I'm going to accomplish in 2018:

* Publish 3x as many words as I did in 2017. This works out to roughly one blog
  post per week.
* Contribute one major feature to an open source project.
* Read 52 books. I have a few potential projects in mind and will report back
  later.
* Work my way through every problem in the *Awodey Category Theory* book.
* Publish an academic paper contributing something novel to the field of
  computer science.

Sounds like I'm going to be a busy boy, doesn't it? But wait, there's more!


## Fostering New Relationships

I met a guy in Chiang Mai during my travels. His name is Samer and during the
two weeks we were bunk-mates, it became more and more obvious that I need to be
a lot more like Samer than I am today.

Hear me now, rude boy. Sam has this amazing knack for people. He was friends
with literally everyone I ran into during the course of my stay. Need your hair
cut? Oh, Sam is going hiking with the hairdresser next week. Want some pizza?
Yeah, that waitress is Sam's girlfriend -- despite the fact that he never eats
pizza and they met at the pizza place. Random guy at the computer? Yeah he went
to school in Texas with Sam. The list goes on and on and on and on and seriously
on.

What the hell. How does he do it? I asked. Ready for the secret?

He talks to people.

Crazy, right? Okay kind of stupid in retrospect, but I guess I hadn't realized
how many people I was missing out on by not *going out of my way* to meet
people.

I've lived in Denver for like eight months now, and I know, what? Maybe 20
people? No wonder [Denver hasn't been jiving for me][2017]; people are what make
a place and I don't know nearly enough people.

[2017]: http://sandymaguire.me/blog/2017-review

So let's fix that in 2018. My quantifiable goals in this domain are:

* Have two five-minute conversations a day with people I don't know.
* For every week that I'm not in a serious, committed relationship, go on a date
  with somebody new.
* By the end of the year, have brought together a community of people that meet
  regularly.

Over the last few days, I've been annoying my friends with barrages of messages
along the lines of "what are your goals for 2018? I'm looking for inspiration."
