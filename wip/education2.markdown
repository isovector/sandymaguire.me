There's a reason I mention all of this. I'm curious about what makes a
successful autodidact. I've taught myself a lot of things in the past, but it
was never particularly *intentional.* Nor was it particularly efficient. So how
can we do better?

[The obvious thing][obvious] is to just avoid all of the obvious ways that
people failure in learning / teaching. People fail to teach by the above
methods, and people fail to learn by missing the fundamentals, by not following
through on their desires to learn, and by not actually putting in the work.

[obvious]:

If you're pessimistic, you might also add "because they're incapable of learning
it" to that list, but I think that's silly. The problem is almost always
motivation---if you gave someone a month to master a skill or everyone they
loved would die and they'd become destitute and someone would squirt lemon juice
into their eye, you can bet they'd work pretty fucking hard to master that
skill. If you want something badly enough, you'll move heaven and earth to make
it happen. Capability won't even cross your mind.



you need to know enough to be able to critique yourself
sort skills by importance
always have an immediate next action
theory can not replace practice, but it sure as shit can enhance it
let the theory guide your practice
