Hip hop is a vastly diverse genre. Therefore, it shouldn't be a surprise that
different sub-genres of hip hop will appeal to different people. Traditionally,
there are a few primary facets of rap music worth paying attention to. These are
the *beats*, the *lyricism* and the *flow*.

The *beats* are the backing instrumentals. Hip hop is different from most other
genres of music in that it generally has very simple backing. It is not uncommon
for a beat to be a few bars sampled from a completely different genre (funk is a
popular one, though!)

The *lyricism* is a little harder to define, but roughly corresponds both to how
clever the lyrics are, and to the complexity of the rhyme scheme. As a genre of
music that leans heavily on words, rappers often turn to word play and phrases
that can be interpreted in many different ways. Furthermore, lyricism also
encapsulates the rhyming scheme; some rappers might rhyme only in couplets,
while others will have upwards of ten rhymes in a single line.

The *flow* of a track is the delivery of its verses. A flow might be smooth or
staccato. It might be easygoing and reminiscent of storytelling, or it might
feel artificial and affected. The flow, in other words, characterizes the
performance of a song.

I've tried to make a starter playlist that should be widely accessible, yet
still be varied in its selections. You probably won't like all of these, but if
you don't like any, then rap might not be the genre for you.

As you work your way through the following tracks, try to pay attention to the
beats, lyricism and flow of each. It is likely that one of the three will speak
to you more than the others. You will likely notice a correlation between the
tracks you like and those that more heavily feature your favored aspect.
