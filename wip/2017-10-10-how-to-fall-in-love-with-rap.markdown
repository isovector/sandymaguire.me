## How to use this guide

This guide is divided into rough "subgenres" of rap music. For the most part,
these aren't going to be the subgenres you'd find in other listings. Rather,
they categorize the music by its strengths and notable features rather than by
its social context. Instead of listing music as, *e.g.* "southern crunk," it
might instead be listed as "poetic." While the traditional labeling schemes are
helpful when you're familiar with the genre itself, they're not particularly
useful when you don't know what you're looking for.

And so, I would suggest this guide be used in the following way. If you're
completely new to rap music, listen to a random sampling of the tracks TODO
immediately below this. I've handpicked these to be relatively diverse in their
sound, yet all should be relatively easy to listen to. Should you not like any
of them, rap is probably not going to be a genre you'll enjoy.

However, if you do like some, pay attention to the feelings they evoke in you,
and to what it is you like about them. Do you like the music behind the words?
Maybe it's the impressive speed with which these people are able to spit out
words. Or it could be you appreciate the storytelling or poetry of the lyrics.
Once you have a rough understanding of the parts you like, find the closest
subgenre listed below, and go through its tracks. If you find an artist whose
music you like, branch out to other subgenres they're listed under and give
those a listen, too.

With any luck, you'll find a few artists you like. From there, I'd suggest
asking Google what their best album is, and listening to that all the way
through. You're probably not going to like every track on it, but I'm certain
you'll find some that you do. Rap music often features multiple artists on a
track, and so explore other artists who collaborate with your favorites. Rappers
with similar styles will usually work together, and so this is a great way to
expand your taste beyond this guide.

There's a lot of prose in this guide, which is usually intended to give you some
signposts for things to which you might benefit from paying attention. That
being said, the majority of the contributions here is the list of music itself.
Feel free to skip the text if all you're looking for is some new bangers.


## Caveats and other disclaimers

Rap music comes with its fair share of criticism towards many of its themes.
It's been accused of being misogynistic, racist, of promoting drug-use and
immoral behavior, alongside a bevy of other antisocial accusations. While these
blasts are not without merit, it is crucial to remember that rap music is a
*medium*. In the same way that it's possible to appreciate well-written
literature even while disagreeing with its central premise, one should be
willing to grant hip-hop the same suspension of dislike. Of course, if a track
or artist isn't for you, that's OK, but one should be capable of appreciating
the art of a medium even without necessarily approving of its subject.

Along these lines, often rap music will deal with themes (and have titles) that
might be considered unpleasant to a sensitive listener. It should be understood
that this list is a compilation of music that I like, and as such, I will not
censor myself of any titles or tracks that might be deemed impolite.

Furthermore, the music represented here is first and foremost *music that I
like.* If you are already a rap aficionado, the absence of a favorite track or
artist of yours, it's nothing to be upset about. If you think my list is
drastically wrong, feel free to write your own (and if you send me an email,
I'll even link to it here!)

And so, without further ado, let's get into the music.


## Start Here

## The Three Pillars

Hip-hop is a vastly diverse genre. Therefore, it shouldn't be a surprise that
different sub-genres of hip-hop will appeal to different people. In my opinion,
there are a few primary facets of rap music worth paying attention to. These are
the *beats*, the *lyricism* and the *flow*.

The *beats* are the backing instrumentals. Hip-hop is different from most other
genres of music in that it generally has very simple backing. It is not uncommon
for a beat to be a few bars sampled from a completely different genre (funk is a
popular one, though!)

The *lyricism* is a little harder to define, but roughly corresponds both to how
clever the lyrics are, and to the complexity of the rhyme scheme. As a genre of
music that leans heavily on words, rappers often turn to word play and phrases
that can be interpreted in many different ways. Furthermore, lyricism also
encapsulates the rhyming scheme; some rappers might rhyme only in couplets,
while others will have upwards of ten rhymes in a single line.

The *flow* of a track is the delivery of its verses. A flow might be smooth or
staccato. It might be easygoing and reminiscent of storytelling, or it might
feel artificial and affected. The flow, in other words, characterizes the
performance of a song.

As you go through the following tracks, try to keep an ear open to the three
pillars: beats, lyricism and flow. See if any of them resounds more strongly in
you than the others.
