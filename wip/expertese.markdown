One of my favorite papers of all time is Chambliss' *The Mundanity of
Excellence: An Ethnographic Report on Stratification and Olympic Swimmers.*
Chambliss spends a few years following competitive swimmers across all skill
levels, and analyzes what differentiates competitors of different skill levels.
Its key results are that skill levels are discretely stratified --- a competitor
"may consistently qualify for the Junior Nationals, but not for the Seniors" or
"may swim at the Olympics, and never return to Junior Nationals." The claim is
that this is not the effect of quantitative changes, but that swimming at the
Senior Nationals is *fundamentally different* than at the Junior Nationals.
Which is to say, that Olympic swimmers aren't *faster* than their local
swim-meet analogues; they are swimming *completely differently.* The discrete
stratification of a natural result of this; being physically more fluid-dynamic
than your peers might be an advantage to help you win at one level, but that's a
micro-optimization that is too small to bump you between strata.

Moving between these layers of skill, Chambliss argues, requires qualitative
changes. In the swimming example, kicking harder than other people is a
quantitative change that won't excel you to greatness; but kicking *differently*
will. Experts aren't just "better amateurs."

If generalizable, this has important ramifications for becoming excellent at
your skill of choice. Playing to your strengths will help in the short term, but
resign you to doing more of what you already are doing. Improving areas in which
you're weak will be more fruitful, in that it will unlock other areas for
improvement --- things that you're currently unaware of due to mitigating your
weaknesses.

To be concrete, I've been playing guitar for five years now. And I'm
embarrassingly bad at it for having played for five years. For the vast majority
of that time I didn't really know what I was doing; I'd look up chords for a
song I liked, ensure that it didn't have any scary-looking ones, and then
memorize that and strum the chords out whenever I had a guitar around. Often I
chose ballad-type songs that were heavily singing-focused, so I could rely on
being able to sing as a crutch for my bad guitar playing.

It sorta worked. I was "fine" at guitar. I had a few songs I could pull out and
impress girls with. But I wasn't good by any measure.

Three weeks ago, someone played me a song by finger-picking her way through it.
It was the first time I'd ever *seen someone do that.* It sounded really good,
and it looked easy. So I spent the next week practicing that, and by god, my
guitar playing got 10x better.

Two weeks ago, I called my friend Rory and we chatted about music for a while. I
marveled to him about my newfound skills, and he showed me how barre chords are
laid out on the fretboard. Not only that they are, but *what the pattern is.* It
was a qualitatively different way of thinking about the fretboard, about
learning patterns and landmarks, rather than trying to memorize what letter goes
in every single one of the little boxes. So I studied and internalized this too.
And again, my guitar playing got 10x better.

Three weeks is about 1.5% of the time I've spent playing guitar. Seeing a 100x
skill improvement in such a short time, perfectly correlated with *trying new
things* is good evidence in favor of Chambliss.

I see this a lot in programming too. There's a stupid meme going around about
whether some programmers are 10x better than the average. The masses shout "no,"
but they're wrong. I'm not sure if this is self-delusion or simply a selection
bias, but the best programmers I know are easily 1000x better than the average.
Maybe not in terms of *productivity,* but certainly in terms of problem solving.
The best programmers aren't people who have necessarily been doing it longer;
they're people who have been systematically tackling hard problems, and learning
new tools, and most importantly, (gasp!) learning the underlying theory.

This is by no means a dig at the average programmers, nor an assessment of their
worth. Most of the world's problems are indeed [boring and require more
tediousness than anything else.](/blog/brilliance) Just because we have
Dostoevsky doesn't mean we don't also need E. L. James --- but it would be a
mistake to say that these are two authors of the same caliber.

On this topic, however, Chambliss has some good news. Qualitative stratification
is so important that it absolutely dwarfs the effect of "natural talent" or
"hard work."
