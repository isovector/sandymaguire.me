Life is pretty fucking good.

I haven't been "working" for about nine months now. I mean, I've been working,
but I haven't been *working.* Like, for the man. Like doing things I don't want
to be doing. But I'm staying busy and making cool stuff. I'm my own boss. Most
surprisingly, I'm making enough money to pay rent somehow.

How? [I'm writing the book I've always wanted to write][patreon], and other
people seem to be pretty excited about it. If you can [spare a few
bucks][signup] to help me live my dream I'd really appreciate it! If not, I
still love you anyway. But I digress. That's not really what I want to talk
about today.

My friend Vikrem hit me up the other day. "You ever think that [life] advice has
this unwritten undercurrent of enshrining the idea that this [stuff] is hard?
Everything that seems to give advice also wants to sneakily say that [living in
the modern world] is very difficult."

Vikrem was talking about tech startups, but I think his point is far more
general.

Life isn't really that hard. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it all boils down
to three things.

1. Question advice from the majority.
2. Keep your options open.
3. Invest in yourself.

Let's go through these one by one.


## The Majority is Almost Always Wrong

Never, ever forget that markets are efficient. What I mean by this is that
people respond to incentives---if X is generally considered to be a good idea,
you can bet your boots that someone is getting rich off of that opinion.

*This is true regardless of whether or not X really and truly is a good idea.*

As such, it's hard to know if X is actually a good idea, or merely whether
someone's livelihood depends on people doing X.

A good test for which is which is to follow the money. See who is getting rich
off of X, and ask yourself whether or not the world would survive if someone
weren't doing that job.

It's no surprise that often times, the interests of advertisers are out of
alignment with our own. As a society, we seem to be slowly building cultural
vaccinations against advertising. We know often times we buy things we don't
need because they were well advertised. The knowledge often doesn't stop us, but
it's a good first step.

It's easy enough to look back in history and find things that people believed.
Smoking is good for you. The church is always right. TODO add more here

It seems foolish to assume that unlike every civilization in the history of
history that *for reals you guys, this time we're right about everything.*

Without passing any judgment one way or another, here are some things the
majority thinks.

* A small amount of daily alcohol will improve longevity.
* Buying a house is cheaper than renting.
* Children who are home-schooled will be missing social skills.
* Democracy is fundamentally a good idea.
* Making more money is better than making less money.
* Radiohead is more sophisticated than Nickleback.
* You need to have a job.

I mean, I might be the last person to be qualified to talk about this stuff---a
few months ago I watched a youtube tutorial about how to eat an orange. And I
paid *rapt* attention.






for example
Hiring your first engineer at a startup is incredibly hard. As a founder you’re already stretched dangerously thin on time. There are bugs to fix, customers to close and any number of urgent existential fires that demand your full attention. You know you should be spending more time on hiring but it’s a battle to find it.
from YC today
