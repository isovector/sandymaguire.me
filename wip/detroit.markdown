I have six months' worth of liquid cash sitting in the bank, and another ten
years' worth of runway in relatively-liquid investments. I could pick up a
six-figure job in a week by snapping my fingers. I have a spotless credit
record, and have lived in more apartments without complaint in the last five
years than most people do in their lives. I'm a nerdy guy who would prefer to
stay in and do math than to go out partying. I'm about as safe a tenant as you
can possibly get.

And yet, it's not enough for the bureaucratically-minded landlords of Ottawa.
Because I don't have a job I'm considered a liability, or something? They want
me to sign with a guarantor. My parents would make great candidates they
say---despite the fact that my parents are also retired and are living on
less per month than I am.

I don't get it.

Maybe the problem is that I'm not creative enough, but I honestly cannot figure
out why this is such a hard problem.
