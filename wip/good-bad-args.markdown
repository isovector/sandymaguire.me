* arguments have structure
    * based on hypotheses
    * have an output
    * we can reuse the same argument structure to make different points
      * often via metaphor; first need to show equivalence of hypotheses
          * especially along the axis of interest
      * makes it valuable to spot good ones, so you can use them again in other
          contexts
      * therefore, a bad argument is bad whenever you see it, regardless of the
          point it's making
    * composable, so we can build bigger arguments by combining smaller ones
        together
* bad arguments suggest:
    * no better args (good ideas have good arguments behind them)
    * intellectual laziness --- haven't spent the time to think of a better one
    * not actually an argument (bottom line first). politically driven.
    * therefore, regardless of why the argument is bad, it being argued is grounds
        to believe in it less.
* covid
    * "if it saves JUST ONE LIFE it's worth it no matter what"
    * ok but uh the flu kills maybe 60k people per year, and we're not all up in
        arms about that
    * that's not saying dealing with covid is UNIMPORTANT, just that you could
        make tremendously better arguments than this one
          * this is not an argument. it's virtue signaling. it's communicating
              "i care about the virus" and probably also "i am a democrat" and
              also "i think republicans who DONT wear masks are stupid"
* we should judge an argument by its strength, not by the moral point it's
    making. presumably truly moral judgements will have strong reasons for
    believing them
* certainty isn't required. likeliness is enough





There's a weird fetishism of science in this day and age. People who haven't
used the scientific method since they were a child are nevertheless subscribed
to things like "I Fucking Love Science" --- a website that uh, doesn't see to
have much to do about science at all. For example, its headline today is about
"how racists ruined a monolith," and how some scientist "claims Earth is
collaborating with a galactic federation." Interesting? Maybe, but its hard to
argue that these things are at all related to science, in any sense of the word.

But we see this fetishism everywhere. To deservedly pick on psychology,
[somewhere between only 25% and
50%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis#Psychology_replication_rates)
of their published findings can be reproduced by other people trying the same
experiment again. While the field can certainly put on the veneer of science, by
"running experiments" and using terminology like "p-values", their inability to
see the same thing twice 50% of the time (to be charitable) casts a great deal
of doubt on their methodology. Clearly this is a field that desires *looking
scientific* much more than they desire *doing science.*

This strange, pretentious obsession even exists in the mainstream media, where
characters save the day using "science." [Now this is the power of
math!](https://youtu.be/Gt6lclzhJsw?t=190)

You can spot a scientist when you meet one, way before they ever tell you their
occupation. These are people who live and breathe the scientific method. They
are constantly trying to falsify hypotheses. In university, I'm ashamed to admit
that I boasted I could tell how well any woman kissed, just by looking at her.
My biologist roommate was dating a few women at the time, and immediately called
bullshit on my claim and asked me which of his girlfriends was the best kisser.
I took a guess, and was wrong.

Scientists just can't turn off this way of looking at the world. But you don't
need to be a professional to do science.

I think one of the greatest disservices of modern western culture is this false
idolatry of science. Somehow we've all become accustomed to the idea that
science happens in laboratories by men and women in lab coats. But this is not
the truth. You don't need a bunson burner and a bunch of erlenmeyer flasks to do
science; you just need to ask a question, imagine what the world must be like if
it were true, and if it were false, and then go out and see which of those two
worlds you're living in. Like my roommate; if I really could spot which woman
was the best kisser, a world in which that were true would be one in which my
clairvoyance agreed with his experience --- indeed, with *everyone's*
experience. No test tubes or lab coats required.


## II

I see a worrisome trend in the world; namely, that as a culture, our arguments
are getting worse. Ideas, and relatedly, culture, can spread in one of two ways:
by coercion, or by argument. Coercion covers not only the ideas the gunman
aiming at your head wants you to say, but less dramatically, also the things we
trust "on authority." It's the things that society dictates [you can't
say.](http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html) To a large extent, coercion covers
most of the things we believe culturally --- all of those things we believe but
never chose to believe.

This is an insidious thing. If you never chose to believe something in the first
place, the immediate sense is that it's *just how the world is.* Coerced
beliefs are hard things to shake off.

The other tool in our idea-spreading toolbox is the *argument.*  Arguments are
an incredible piece of technology for sharing not only *what you believe* but
also the provenance of *why you believe it.* By argument, I don't mean the
shouting matches you have with a spouse, but rather the sort of thing we hope
policy decisions are made on the basis of. Supportive claims.

If your goal is to believe true things, you are much more likely to be
successful if your beliefs are based on strong arguments. It's not a guarantee
by any means, but the only way you can be right *without* strong arguments is by
accident.

If believing true things is not something you value, no argument I can make will
change your mind, and you might as well stop reading now.

Of course, people get in disagreements all the time for reasons that aren't
truth-seeking. This happens to me all the time, where I'm too dumb to notice my
friend isn't asking me for the truth, but for support. Or maybe a disagreement
is just a way for two parties to signal to each other what team they're on ---
if you're arguing on the surface about mail-in voting, you might actually
arguing about morals and gun-control and whatever other things the red and blue
teams disagree on.

Identify disagreements of this sort quickly. They're never productive, except
maybe to signal to some third party about what you believe. But there are
cheaper ways to accomplish that (possibly you could just tell them directly!)

A good test for if you're in one of these unproductive disagreements is
Sebastian Marshall's idea of [don't argue with
peasants](http://sebastianmarshall.com/arguing-with-peasants-shows-a-lack-of-self-discipline).
If you or your interlocutor is unlikely to change their mind, and the world
won't change significantly if on the off-chance they do, you're wasting your
time.

But, for those too-rare occasions you find yourself trying to hash out the truth
with another intellectually-honest person, your ability to form, communicate and
evaluate strong arguments is paramount.



For whatever idiotic reason, the customary example of a logical argument goes as
follows:

1. Socrates is a man
2. All men are mortal
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal

Not only is this boring and self-evident, it's [not even wrong.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong)
