I just met a techbro business-man. Despite having lived in San Francisco for
three years, my exposure to the techbro business-man has been mercifully light.
But today I got cornered by one in a hostel. Embarrassingly, it took me like
twenty minutes before I realized.

So I met this guy, let's call him Frank. I asked what Frank was doing tonight,
and he vaguely mentioned some sort of "entrepreneur dinner." Cool! Maybe this is
a guy who *does things!* I inquired into his business. "We're a software
company" he said. Neat. Do you make anything? "We make websites for other
companies." Oh. So you don't have a product? "But we have a product."

At this point, I hadn't yet mentioned that I'm a software guy. I figured he was
just giving me the runaround because he is a nerd who doesn't know how talk
about his business without using big words, but not enough of a nerd to realize
that the big words usually scare off people. I told him that I'm a software guy
too, but his explanations didn't get any better.

Somehow we started talking about fintech, and he suggested that "maybe we should
decentralize money, but without using blockchain technology." What an
interesting idea, Frank. Tell me more!

"We should have one company and run all the money through them."

Oh. OK. So your plan to decentralize money is to centralize it? Good plan Frank.

For the next twenty minutes he bluffed his way through our conversation. My
assumption was that he was stupid, not that he was being dishonest. Then he
asked me to critique his company's website, and it was full of the usual
business copy. You know, things like:

> With the aspiration to be the world-class technology company, we aim to take
> leverage of emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine
> Learning, Cloud Computing, and data technology and integrate these
> technologies into our custom made software and smart electronic that gives
> your enterprise the full-power of business automation.

or

> Machine intelligence considers a broad array of data. Real-time contextual
> signals, and preference filters, match workflows to recipients. We
> orchestrate everything with sophisticated precision.

*There's no information here!* It's literally just wasting space!

Eventually I caught wise to the fact that he was not the engineer he claimed to
be, but instead, dreadfully, he was the business-man. I told him, rather
frankly, that I don't like most business-men I run into, and that his actions
weren't helping that relationship.

Frank got defensive, "This is just how the real world works. You always gotta be
hustling." He said something about how Elon Musk is a businessman. He asked what
I did --- intending to knocking me down a peg. Interesting how he hadn't shown
any interest in me in the earlier twenty minutes! He was a visibly fazed when I
told him I've written a couple of very successful books, and no, you can't buy
them on Amazon, and no, I don't just give them away for free.

This guy, and people like him, is a leach. He's got no skills, and has built a
little house of cards around himself by name dropping reputable firms. He
mentions buzzwords whenever he can, without even being anywhere close to being
on-topic. Anyone with half a brain could see through him (at least after twenty
minutes), and yet, somehow, a terrifying percentage of the world is run by
people exactly like this.

My question is *how do they get away with it?* Assuming this guy actually does
make money for himself, I guess he wheels and deals (read: bullshits) his way
into gigs, outsources all of the labor for pennies, and eventually probably
under-delivers.

None of this is to say that I don't understand the role of business. I can
respect someone who is good at business (as opposed to a business-man) because I
really don't want to have to deal with all of that shit. You can be an honest
human and be good at business.

But Frank was not like that. He started selling me --- a guy in a tanktop
standing in a hostel kitchen --- less than a minute into our interaction.
Selling me the image that he was some big important entrepreneur. That he knew
about technology, and was helping shape the future.

I can't tell who has less self-confidence: Frank, for feeling the urge to
signal as badly as he does; or the people he sells to, who somehow don't manage
to call him on his bullshit.
