There's a self-evident truth that I feel like most anti-capitalism rhetoric
misses---that capitalism's governing dynamics are inescapable. Regardless of the
society you live in, if you're smart and you need something done exceptionally
well, you're going to seek out someone knows how to do that thing exceptionally
well, and make a deal with them. It might not be in fiat currency, but maybe in
equal trade, or in a personal favor, or in future political endeavors.

This sort of idea is pretty fundamental the human psyche; why do you think we
say "much obliged" when a friend does something nice for us?

Like it or not, human abilities are not fungible. One electrician's work is not
the same as another's, regardless of if you give them the same amount of time or
money. That's not to say that work can't be "good enough"---in that it
functions as desired, and we don't care about anything more than this.

But "good enough" is context-sensitive. Shoddy electrical work might be good
enough for a makeshift camp at Burning Man, but might not be good enough for a
city block in Manhattan.

As long as there are differences between abilities, there will be inequality in
abilities, and thus inequality in terms of wealth. No matter what regulations
you put in place to curb inequality, industrious people will always find a way
around it---whether it take the form of a black market or what-have-you.

Before you cast the first stone, I'd bet dollars to donuts that you've
participated in illicit behavior before---maybe you bought pot from a neighbor,
paid the "small fee" to enter Peru, drank alcohol before the legal age, or
helped a friend move for a few bucks and didn't report it on your tax filing. Do
any of these things make you a terrible person? No.

And so I'm sort of baffled when people tell me they want to abolish capitalism.
Like, what would that world look like? Maybe communism? As Bryan Caplan points
out in [The Myth of the Rational Voter][myth], even communist states are
susceptible to such dynamics of inequality:

Caplan goes on:

Now, I'm not suggesting that we take lessons in morality from Stalin, but I
don't think anyone would admit that there is an inequality of knowledge between
nuclear scientists and laypeople. Though it's interesting to note that even
under as anti-capitalist circumstances as you can find, inequality somehow still
rears its "ugly" head.

When people say they don't like capitalism, instead I think they're conflating
capitalism with the following trends:

* People can make money at the expense of the environment.
* Humans tend to prioritize short-term gains over long-term investments.
* Certain professions pay better than others.
* Some people are so exceptionally rich, but most people are only managing
    paycheck-to-paycheck.

But primarily, I think when people say they don't like capitalism, what they're
really saying is "I feel helpless. I don't like the status-quo, and I feel like
there's nothing I can do to change it. So let's tear it down."
