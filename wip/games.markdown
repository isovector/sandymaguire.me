I really like small ideas that change the way we look at the world. Recently
I've been thinking a lot about *game theory* and *memetics.* If you're not
entirely sure what those things entail, don't despair---ideas are often better
understood in context.

Yesterday I made a joke about cancer. About five years ago I got a wicked
sunburn, and my skin there has been red ever since. "It's my skin cancer," I
say. As you can see, the joke is not particularly *off-color.* I've been telling
it for years, which is probably a statement more about my sense of humor than
anything else.

My friend called me out on this joke. "Don't say that," she said. I hear this
fairly often---it's generally said in the sense of "don't tempt fate." This is
stupid. Words have no power over causality, and making jokes about cancer *will
not give me cancer.* My terrible nutritional habits might, but my words won't.
This is the rebuttal I give to people. But more often than not, they're still
uneasy.

There's been a lot of cancer in my friend's life, which I think is where her
knee-jerk reaction comes from. I get that. I can understand "I'd prefer not to
be reminded about that" but not "don't say that." Maybe people mean these things
interchangeably, but language is important and let's not say one thing when we
mean another.

Paul Graham has a exceptionally illuminating essay on the topic of [What You
Can't Say][cantsay]. I first read it a few years ago and still find myself
milling it over on a weekly basis. My takeaway of his argument is that by
training people to not say things, you remove their ability to think about those
things. As a result, if you're looking for fresh ideas---and more likely to not
to be *correct*---a good place to start is by talking about the things you're
not allowed to say.

At risk of dating this essay, here is a quick list of things I came up with that
you're *not allowed to say* in this day and age. Some of them I agree with,
others I don't. The point is not in the particular examples, merely that you'd
be shocked to hear them in polite company, and that if you held them, you'd be
careful about whom you let know.

* Democracy is not just broken, but fundamentally a bad idea.
* Donald Trump is a great leader.
* Men are better than woman at most things.
* Spirituality is a mental illness.
* The Nazis were right about a lot of things.
* The age of consent should be lowered to 8.

I realize that these are distracting examples, and I'm sorry for that.
Unfortunately, made-up illustrations wouldn't elicit the same reaction; it's one
thing to read about 1984's doublethink, but it's a very different thing to catch
yourself in the process of actually doing it.

My default position on this "things you can't say" business is to just go ahead
and say things. No ideas are sacred. Some are true, others are useful---a small
number are both---but nothing is sacred. Ideas stand or fall on their own
merits. It's useful to have a default position, because it [leaves me a line of
retreat][retreat]; it means I'm allowed to question things without being lynched
for it.

I'm not sure that last part is strictly true with today's politics being what
they are, but it's a useful idea that lets me sleep at night.

Let's switch tack. A different, close friend of mine recently had a death in the
family. My significant other and I felt a significant amount of societal
pressure to attend the funeral, even though we didn't know the deceased, nor did
our friend suggest anything along the lines that we should go. But there was
cultural pressure nevertheless---going to the funerals of people close to you is
Just Something You Do.

And I'm ashamed to admit it, but I almost caved in. I almost got bullied into
going, even though I'm not entirely sure who the "bully" is. I'm sure someone
reading will think to themselves "oh this Sandy guy is terrible, how dare he
describe going to a funeral as bullying." But it is, and again, it's important
to call things by their names.

(Instead, I suggested to my friend that we go out for a beer and he share
stories about the deceased. I'm not heartless, and do care about him.)

This is again a sort of default position. I Don't Go To Funerals; I've never
been to one, and I never will. "It's nothing personal, it's just that I don't do
these things. But look, let's do something else, because you're important to
me."

So what's the point?
