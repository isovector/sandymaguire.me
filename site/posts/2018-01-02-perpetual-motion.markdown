I had a profound experience the other day. In preparation for the new year, I've
been doing a lot of thinking, and as an exercise I asked myself a question.

"What do I want my life to look like?"

Without missing a beat, the answer came to me.

"Not like this."

Damn. That's one hell of a bomb to drop on yourself, but it rang true. As we
know, the truth is a gift to always be accepted graciously, and so it was time
to face the music. The first step to fixing a problem is to admit that there's a
problem.

After very little soul searching -- apparently I already knew the answer -- I
realized with what I was dissatisfied. For as long as I can remember, my biggest
fear has been [complacency][murder]. Complacency is the culprit who will kill
your potential without your noticing. It's an duplicitous beast that rides under
the guise of "comfort." It's a life lived *pleasantly* but not *satisfactorily*.

I found myself with waning health, caused by working a job full of external and
artificial stresses. A job that I liked, but didn't *love*. A job that paid in
money and experience, though neither of which were things I actually needed.
I've got enough money, and I've got more than enough experience. A job that
sucked enough of my energy that I wasn't capable of creating the things I wanted
to be creating in the negative space around office hours.

And so what was the point? I found myself working to acquire resources I didn't
need at the expense of ones I did. It reminded me of a quote that my friend
recently shared with me:

> "Man surprised me most about humanity. Because he sacrifices his health in
> order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And
> then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the
> result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as
> if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived."
>
> -James J. Lachard

Damn. Mull that thought over for a second. I'll bet it rings uncomfortably close
to home, doesn't it? It certainly did for me.

I don't want to die having never really lived. Guess I'd better do something
about it. And that's about as good of a segue into my goals for 2018 as there
will ever be!

If there's one weird habit I have, it's doing math recreationally. If there are
two weird habits I have, it's doing math recreationally and putting taglines on
years. These are little phrases to remind me of what I'm supposed to be focusing
on during the year.

2013 was the year of doing something with my life. 2014: the year of building
infrastructure. 2015 was about consolidating power. You get the picture.

2018 is the year of *perpetual motion*.

What I mean by that is that I want to spend 100% of my time working on the
things I want to be working on. I want to be always [moving towards the
goal][moving].

[moving]: http://mindingourway.com/moving-towards-the-goal/

What all of this cashes out as is a couple core pillars of fundamentals I feel
like I am missing or at which I am not yet good enough. These sub-goals are
ambitious as all-get-out, and there is no way in hell I'm going to be able to
accomplish them given my current levels of operation. My only chance is to
induce an extreme shift in lifestyle. The pillars and their components are the
tactics; the lifestyle is the desired result.


## Producing Cool Things

I have a role model. [His name is Piero Scaruffi][scaruffi]. In the internet
jargon of today: this guy fucks. [Holden Karnofsky][holden], via [Luke

See what I mean? This dude is prolific. This dude is the dude I aspire to be.

So I'm going to make it happen. Along these lines, here are the quantifiable
things I'm going to accomplish in 2018:

* Publish 3x as many words as I did in 2017. This works out to roughly one blog
  post per week.
* Contribute one major feature to an open source project. I have a few potential
  projects in mind and will report back later.
* Read 52 books.
* Work my way through every problem in the *Awodey Category Theory* book.
* Publish an academic paper contributing something novel to the field of
  computer science.

Sounds like I'm going to be a busy boy, doesn't it? But wait, there's more!


## Fostering New Relationships

I met a guy in Chiang Mai during my travels. His name is Samer and during the
two weeks we were bunk-mates, it became more and more obvious that I need to be
a lot more like Samer than I am today.

Hear me now, rude boy. Sam has this amazing knack for people. He was friends
with literally everyone I ran into during the course of my stay. Need your hair
cut? Oh, Sam is going hiking with the hairdresser next week. Want some pizza?
Yeah, that waitress is Sam's girlfriend -- despite the fact that he never eats
pizza and they met at the pizza place. Random guy at the computer? Yeah he went
to school in Texas with Sam. The list goes on and on and on and on and seriously
it just keeps going on.

What the hell. How does he do it? I asked. Ready for the secret?

He talks to people.

Crazy, right? Okay kind of stupid in retrospect, but I guess I hadn't realized
how many people I was missing out on by not *going out of my way* to meet
people.

I've lived in Denver for like eight months now, and I know, what? Maybe 20
people? No wonder [Denver hasn't been jiving for me][2017]; people are what make
a place and I don't know nearly enough people.

[2017]: http://sandymaguire.me/blog/2017-review

So let's fix that in 2018. My quantifiable goals in this domain are:

* Have two five-minute conversations a day with people I don't know.
* For every week that I'm not in a serious, committed relationship, go on a date
  with somebody new.
* By the end of the year, have brought together a community of people that meet
  regularly, even without me acting as a catalyst.

It's hard to overstate how excited I am about this pillar. I don't think I'm bad
at these things, but neither am I fantastic at them. Fostering new relationships
I suspect will be the most important skill I develop in 2018.


## Tactics and Mechanics

Okay fine, so it's well and good to have a bunch of new year's resolutions.
But I'm sure we've all set some goals on January 1st and haven't *entiiiirely*
followed through with them one hundred percent all the way.

Clearly more is needed than just good intentions.

The first and foremost tactic I will be using is the idea of having a [key
habit][key]. The idea is to set one thing every day that should be my primary
focus -- to the extent that I'm allowed to drop everything else on my plate in
order to accomplish it. If I'm terribly behind on any of my quantifiable tasks
above, they'll be the key habit for the day, and I'm allowed to go out and spend
the day meeting girls, or whatever.

[key]: http://sebastianmarshall.com/key-habit-today

If the key habit is nothing urgent (like getting back above the yellow brick road
of succeeding at being the person I want to be), it's up for grabs. I've been
doing this for a few days, and some of my key habits have been:

* Build systems for 2018 (cashed out as this key habit idea)
* Figure out goal tracking. Start blog post (cashed out as a
  [beeminder][beeminder]-esque spreadsheet and the post you're reading now)

[beeminder]: http://beeminder.com

(I'm only a few days in, so there are not a lot of examples, but I expect
they'll all look like this.)

Once I have my key habit in place, I look through my [GTD][gtd] list for any
tasks that I want to make progress on that fit the theme, as well as add
anything ad-hoc to this list from my brain. Finishing everything on the task
list isn't crucial, but I've found that having a daily checklist of things to do
helps with motivation. It's helpful both in that I don't need to think about
what to do next, and in that I get a little jolt of dopamine every time I cross
something off of the list.

[gtd]: https://gettingthingsdone.com/

I don't want to commit any money to this year, but we can do one better. If
you've made it all the way through this post, I *urge* you to hold me
accountable to it. Like, to the extent that you'll commit to stop being friends
with me if you're not satisfied with the progress I've made towards these goals
by the end of the year. I would be honored if you'd commit to be disgusted by
any failure of mine along these lines.

To sum up my commitment mechanisms, I have a very low-energy planning strategy
for generating daily motivation. The hope is that this will be able to generate
enough chutzpah to keep me honest about making progress on a day-to-day basis.
And, if that fails, I want everyone I like to lose respect for me.
Neurosis-inducing, to be sure, but nuclear options are pretty effective.
