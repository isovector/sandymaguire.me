> Part 1 of a 3 part series on time management.

How many times have you told yourself "I would love to do X, if I could only
find the time"? If you're anything like me, or the people I know, I'd be willing
to bet even money that it's more often than you would like. Are our lives really
so busy that we can't find time to do any of the things we love?

This rhetorical question doesn't have an answer, because it's the wrong question
to ask in the first place. It's framed incorrectly, because time is never found;
it's made. Unlike most resources in life, each and every day you are allocated a
constant amount of time. Time is a currency, and it's up to you on how you'd
like to spend it.

Western society has a terrible habit in that it tends to *value urgent work over
important work*. It doesn't feel like a stretch to say most people consider
things they love to be important. Unfortunately, because the things we love do
not have deadlines, it feels acceptable to "get around to them later". You
likely know from experience that things we will "get around to later" are most
often the things we don't actually get around to.

The upside to all of this is that making time is surprisingly easy. What might
be more surprising is that it's easy to make time and *not sacrifice anything in
the process*. It seems like a mathematical impossibility; after all, there's no
way to fit 25 hours into 24 hours.

Or is there?

It turns out that if we can come up with a way to *compress 24 hours into 23
hours*, that leaves us an extra hour - effectively getting 25 out of 24.
Compression is the magic key to making this all work, and the best part is that
it's not very magical whatsoever.

Consider all of the things you do on a regular basis. Every day you do a
majority of the following: sleep, shower, source food, eat, brush your teeth,
put on clothes, commute, use the washroom, relax, read, and probably many other
things that you don't really care about. These are all integral parts of living
(hereby known as upkeep), but they're not things you do in-and-of-themselves. By
my rough calculations, this menial upkeep costs you somewhere between 8 and 14
hours every day. I am not considering employment in these calculations.

On average, that's 11 hours a day you spend on things you don't care about. With
a full-time job, we're looking at wasting 80% of our lives away. Any time we can
shave off of these every day tasks immediately turns into free time, and what's
more, it turns into a lot of free time very quickly.

## Production vs Production Capacity

Consider the Acme Widget Factory, a manufacturer of fine doodads. Doodads are
all the latest rage right now, and there is a worldwide shortage of them. Doodad
market analysts project the demand to last for the indefinite future.

The ACF, operating at full capacity, can produce 500 doodads a year. However,
the factory was built in the late '90s, and manufacturing techniques have had
major breakthroughs in the last ten years. If Acme were to spend a year offline,
upgrading their facility to the newest technology, they would be able to
increase their production by 300 doodads every year.

Assuming doodads are not expected to go out of style in the next three years,
this is a good investment. The upgrades will pay for themselves (and more) in
two years, so temporarily halting *production* to invest in increasing the
*production capacity* makes sense. If doodads stay in style for ten years, Acme
will have made 44% more money by increasing their production capacity than if
they just continued producing at their original capacity.

This scenario is analogous to your life. If you can invest a relatively small
amount of time *right now* (halting your production) and use it to reduce the
amount of time you spend on upkeep (increasing production capacity), it will pay
for itself almost immediately.

Especially when you consider that eating and sleeping aren't going to go out of
style in the next ten years.

## Great. Is this actually a good idea?

> Trigger warning: math

Almost always, it turns out. As long as you're increasing the production
capacity of highly-regular tasks, the production hitch will be reimbursed quite
quickly. And I can prove it!

Better yet, I can teach you how to verify for yourself whether or not any
individual production/production capacity (P/PC) trade is wise. The relevant
math is called a value-of-information calculation, and it will help you
determine whether or not an investment is a good idea.

The basic idea is we need to calculate a rough idea of how much this investment
will cost, and a rough idea of how much we'll save in the long-term.

To demonstrate the principle, we'll consider whether or not it's worth spending
10 hours learning how to speed-read. Let's assume we read for 3 hours a week.

In this scenario, our production cost is evident: it's 10 hours. If we expect to
save more than 10 hours after learning how to speed read, then we should go for
it.

According to [wikipedia][sr], the average normal reading speed is 230 words per
minute, while that of speed readers is 700 words per minute.

[sr]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading#Methods

Let's pretend that we are skeptical that this will work. We assign it a
probability of 20% of allowing us to read faster, but it seems unlikely that it
will *make us read slower*. Our expected reading speed after the training is
thus:

$700 wpm * 20\% + 230 wpm * 80\% = 324 wpm$

Here, the equation is our probability statement. Our new reading speed is either
*faster* AND *unlikely* OR *the same* and *likely*. The ANDs become
multiplcation and the ORs become addition. Don't let the math scare you, this
really is easy once you get the hang of it!

At our original speed, we can calculate the number of words read per week as
follows:

$3 hours * 60 \frac{minutes}{hour} * 230 wpm = 41400 words$

And at our expected new reading speed, we can read 41400 words in:

$\frac{41400 words}{324 wpm} = 128 minutes =  ~2 hours$

Hey! Look at that! All of a sudden we are reading the same amount we used to in
a fraction of the time! After learning how to speed read, we expect to save 1
hour per week.

After three months, the speed reading will have paid for itself. After a year
you will have saved almost two entire days. Afer a decade, you're pretty close
to having saved a month.

And remember! This is a very conservative estimate - we are assuming fast
readers, small improvements, and low chances of success. Assuming slow readers
(200 wpm), bigger improvements (900 wpm), and better odds (50%), we gain 81
hours in the first year alone. 81 hours is a _lot_ of time. That's enough time
to [learn four new skills][f20h].

This is just the tip of the iceberg. Imagine finding ways to compress *all* of
your upkeep. Simply becoming [polyphasic][poly] will save you **60 days a year**
all by itself.

While finding time is impossible, making time, it turns out, is exceptionally
easy.

I'd like to close this post with a few ideas of ways you compress your upkeep.
Some of these ideas require spending money, but remember, you can simply turn
money into time by dividing it by your hourly wage. Some of them will be harder
to estimate than others, but they are left as an exercise to the reader.
