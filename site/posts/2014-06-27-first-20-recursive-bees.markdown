## Quoth the Feedback Loops

When discussing what truth is, many wise philosophers (I am **not** being
facetious here) in an attempt to deek the seeming-necessity of *abstracting away
all of their definitions* define truth as such:

> The sentence {snow is white} is true *if and only if* snow is white.

Stop and appreciate the beauty of that reasoning. Something fascinating just
happening there. Somehow the same phrase was used to describe itself, and in
doing so, lead us to an interesting conclusion about what truth really is.

Truth, however, is boring[^1]. What I want to focus on today for a little while
is how this sentence is constructed, why it works. And the answer to that
question, like so many things, is itself in a strange superposition of being
blatantly obvious and remarkably profound.

Quotation marks. Quotation marks are why the sentence works. However, for
clarity's sake, I'm going to put {curly brackets} around the constructs whenever
I'm talking about them. I am going to make my own quotation marks because I am
the king of this blog. {X} will talk about the fact X, while {"X"} will talk
about the sentence "X". This convention frees me to save "real" "quotation
marks" for, like quoting things and expressing doubt and referring to sentences
and the million other little ways we use quotation marks without ever really
thinking about them.

<!--more-->

But I digress. Onwards, with gusto.

You see, when discussing {"snow is white"} (the sentence) we are talking about
a wrapper around {snow being white} (the fact). Usually quotes are used to
denote the object from the referent -- i.e. {cheese} is something you eat while
{"cheese"} is a word.  It's a really clever system to differentiate between
talking about something and talking about talking about something.

[Meta-levels][amplification]. Get used to traveling between them. We're going to
do a lot more of it in a second here.

To get back to my point, there is clearly a relationship between the objects
{snow is white} and {"snow is white"}. If {snow is white} were false, we
probably wouldn't ever say the sentence {"snow is white"}, just like we never
say the sentence {"snow is orange"}. However, the converse isn't true. {Snow is
white} isn't true just because we say {"snow is white"}.

For the most part, saying things are true doesn't actually make them true. But
let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet.

You have probably heard about the paradox between the sentences {"the next
statement is true"} and {"the previous statement is false"}. When ordered beside
one another, a curious thing happens. If you accept the first statement as true,
then you must accept the second true as well -- but then you can't believe the
first, so you don't believe the second, and, well, your brain explodes if you
don't give up soon enough. In fancy math words, we say that this feedback
**diverges** -- it's impossible to find a consistent way of believing it.

This raises the question, however, of whether all mutually-referential
statements necessarily diverge.

It's pretty obvious that they don't, but that didn't mean it's super easy to
come up with striking examples. So I asked my super-smart friend [Malcolm
Ocean][malcolm] to help, and he came up with these three constructs:

1. {"I hate myself"}
2. {"Only a loser would say that"}
3. {"I hate myself for being such a loser"}

They're not a fantastically joyous set of thoughts, but I'm sure you or someone
you know has at one point or another known the inside of a depression loop not
unlike this one.

This depression spiral is a type of **convergent** feedback. Each of the
sentences feeds off of the previous one in a big circle, and they all point in
the same direction -- downwards. In contrast to the previous example, if you
were to follow this chain of reasoning all the way to the bottom... well, your
head would probably also explode, though for entirely different reasons.

## Reflexivity: Less of a Mouthful Than "Lobianness"

There's been this idea skirting around in the back of my head over the last five
or six blog posts I've written. It's incessant and invades a lot of my
waking-hour ruminations as well. Absolutely every time I ponder about minds, it
pokes its head out, begging for attention.

> As an aside, there's a useful metaheuristic to be found here: ideas that keep

> that you *should* give some thought to. Just a thought.

The concept is thus: if you believe something to be true (and have a causal link
to it being true), it's way more likely to be true.  The archetypal example here
is confidence. You're confident *if and only if* you believe that you're
confident. This reeks of a feedback spiral to me.

One day I finally resigned to this concept and decided I'd better [chunk][lego]
it by slapping a name on top of it, and thus being better able to reason about
it. My first attempt was "L&ouml;bianness", you know, since it closely mirrors
[L&ouml;b's theorem][lob] -- math which describes how to prove things you can't
prove, but can prove that you can prove. Which is to say that it affords us
a starting place for begin tackling things which are self-referential.

However, I've learned to do my research before coining things. This can't be
a novel concept -- it shows up too often in psychology for that -- so I did
a bunch of reading. Lo and behold, psychology indeed already has a word for it:
**reflexivity**: the degree to which something's cause and effect can bend and
influence one another.

Another way of putting that is that the reflexivity of X is a measure of how
strong a feedback loop exists between {X} and {"X"}, and *wow* does it seemingly
pop up everywhere. But again, let's not jump ahead too quickly.

## The Magical First 20 Hours

I've written about him before, and you can bet your booties that I'll write
about him again, but there's a man named [Josh Kaufman][josh] who writes some
pretty fantastic books. One of the books in particular is called *[The First 20
Hours][20hours]* in which Josh talks about how fucking amazingly good you can
get at things in a short amount of time. 20 hours, to be precise, if you didn't
get that from the title =)

The secret is essentially this: do some research on what you want to learn, get
a clear picture of what "being good" means to you, and then practice it
intelligently for 20 hours. That's it! That's the whole book, but described in
much more detail and with lots of case studies of cool things Josh learned by
this method[^2].

Why does this work? Well, for the most part, people don't do things at which
they're not very good. Most people give up on things immediately if they aren't
very good at them. By precommitting to practice for 20 hours, you're ensuring
that you have 20 hours more experience than most people at whatever you're
trying to learn. That turns out to be a surprising amount of time to practice
things.

The research beforehand is to ensure that you know how to critique your
own efforts, so that all of your deliberate practice isn't for naught. Pretty
convincing argument, right?

Unfortunately, there is a large subset of people who all reply along the same
lines when I'm done pitching the book at them. Negatively. The most common
replies are:

> **Unbeliever:** "No way. It takes 10,000 hours to get good at something.
> Everybody knows that.  What, are you stupid or something?"

*Response:* Usually taking the [inside view][inside] leads to faulty reasoning,
but it actually saves the day here. Think about all of the things you're good
at. Have you spent 10,000 hours of any of them? Probably not.


> **Unbeliever:** "Well, maybe. Some skills are learnable, but there is no way
> to get good at *X* in 20 hours."

*Response:* You might be right about that, but remember, we're not trying to get
good at things. We're trying to get "good" at things, which is to say, on
a subjective bar set by us!

My favorite response of all time, however, was:

> **Believer:** "Okay, I'm in! Let's try it!"

*Response:* I like you.

This is entirely the right attitude for most things in life, however
I don't think the person in question (let's call this person Barbara to protect
the innocent) had her heart in the right place. I get the distinct impression
that Barbara, whether she explicitly knew it or not, was skeptical of the claim
and decided to get in on the sweet 20 hours action in an attempt to *prove that
it doesn't work*.

It didn't work for Barbara. After 20 hours, she hadn't acquired skill X. She
came back to me and said "we'll, I tried it, and it turns out that learning X is
*impossible* in 20 hours."

That's not to say that Barbara was deliberately sabotaging herself or the effort
whatsoever, except that this mindset of "knowing" it won't work will hold you
back. You'll be afraid of investing yourself fully if you "know" that your
efforts will be all for nothing. You'll leave yourself a [line of retreat][lor]:
"oh, it's okay that I failed. I knew it was impossible to begin with."

Barbara's problem isn't that she was being subversive, it's that she had
inadvertently switched into quotation mode. She wasn't {learning skill X in 20
hours}; she was {trying to learn skill X in 20 hours}.

If you want to {[make a million dollars][trying]}, then {trying to make
a million dollars} is just buying a lottery ticket, even though you know it's
not going to *actually* work. But hey, at least you can say that you *tried*,
and really, isn't that all anyone can ask?

Skill development, and goal completion in general, it would seem, has a high
degree of reflexivity; it's only works if you believe it will work. If not,
you'll be doing nothing more than going through the motions, that is, if you can
even be bothered to do the motions whatsoever.

## Fear and Loathing of Beeminder

While I'm on a roll of shamelessly plugging things, [Beeminder][beeminder] is
a tool that I think is *even more powerful than rapid skill development*. It
generalizes the notion of precommitment as a means of doing things you find
unpleasant. It's the only reason I maintain a reasonably-regular blogging
schedule.

The idea is as follows: you make a quantifiable goal on the Beeminder website.
You give it your credit card, and that's it. If you ever find yourself below the
progress goal you set initially, the website charges an ever-increasing amount
of money to your credit card. The service is free as long as you don't screw up.

Now is that a fantastic business model or what?

As displeased as I was with the response to the *First 20 Hours*, people's
reaction to Beeminder is *much, much worse*.


> "That doesn't sound good for me. I'd lose all of my money."

*Response:* ... (the ineffable sound of a palm and face meeting in silent
sorrow)

If you think about this for like a second, what these people are saying is that
they don't expect the things the goals they profess to have to be
accomplishable. If you aren't willing to put \$5 on the line as a bet to yourself
that you're going to do the things you say you're going to do, your prospects
aren't looking that great.

The reason Beeminder doesn't sound good to these people is because it would
force them pony up or accomplish their goals. Fun, not-very-surprising-fact: the
people who *do* sign-up, for the most part decide to accomplish their goals
rather than lose money unnecessarily for stupid reasons.

You can argue there's a selection bias here, in that the people signing up are
those who anticipate it working. And yes, you're right; there is, but if you're
seriously considering that as a knock-down argument, apparently you weren't
paying very much attention to me in the previous section.

Accomplishing things has a high degree of reflexivity WHICH IS REALLY COOL
BECAUSE IT MEANS YOU CAN GET A SIGNIFICANT HEAD START ON ACCOMPLISHING THINGS
JUST BY DECIDED TO ACCOMPLISH THEM.

Yes, I know that you *know* that already. But *knowing* it isn't the same as
*doing* it. Knowing doesn't count for jack. Doing things is where the magic
happens.

Beeminder does magic. [Go sign up][signup] for it right now, and work a little
magic of your own. Things only happen if you make them happen, and you're the
only one who can do that.
