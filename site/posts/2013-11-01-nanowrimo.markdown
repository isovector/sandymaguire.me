It's officially November, and you know what that means. I'm growing a mustache!
Technically I was growing one anyway, so that's not the most exciting part. No,
actually November means I'm participating in [NaNoWriMo] -- a world-wide sprint
where would-be authors around the globe attempt to write 50,000 words in 30
days. And I'm one of them.

This is not my first NaNoWriMo. Last year I made it to about 15,000 words before
giving up (I missed two days of writing and consequently felt too behind for the
motivation to catch up). This year, I have [beeminder] to help keep me on the
yellow brick road. Furthermore, I've decided to crowd-source my motivation out
to the world. Here's how it works:

If you notice my [beeminder] is below the yellow brick road (or, disappears in
mysterious circumstances), get on my case about it. Write me an email, post a
comment, drop me a facebook message, or yell at me in real life. Whenever you do
so, your name gets a tick mark beside it. **If I fail to complete my novel by
the end of November, I will give \$100 to the person with the most tick marks.**

At the end of all this, I'll either be an official novelist, or have to watch
you laughing all the way to the bank. Sounds like a plan to me.
