Why does science work? In keeping with the wizard-theme I've been cultivating
over the [last][lob] [few][paint] blog posts, I'm going to describe science as
"developing the ability of divination", which is to say, getting starry-eyed and
incanting prophecies about the future.

Kind of neat way to think about the scientific method, isn't it? It's
essentially *just* being a seer and calling the future before it happens.
Hypotheses--based on potential models for how the world works--are formed
before the experiment is carried out, and if the hypothesis turns out to be
true, we elevate our belief in the underlying model. The more times your model
turns out to accurately predict the future, the more trust it garners in your
mind.

If we generalize a little bit from here, we can imagine science as an
environment for evolution. Models are selected in the Darwinian sense by
accurately predicting results. Being falsified is the same as being eaten by
a tiger: it makes it very difficult to pass your genes (or [memes][meme], in this
context) on. Successful models propagate forwards, and derivative ideas are
based on the most successful ancestors.

<!--more-->

To answer my original question, I believe science works partially because it
doesn't care about the ideas themselves; all science cares about is how well an
idea predicts the future. There's an inherent pragmatism to it. The other reason
that science works is because it doesn't trust humans to get things right; it
requires them to *prove* that they're right. Or, at least, that they're *not
wrong*.

Take a second to consider why this act of necessary proving is important.
Throughout all of human history that we know of, two things have invariantly
been true. 1) We assumed we had an accurate model of the world. 2) We were
wrong.

Mythology, geocentricism, flat-earth, spontaneous generation and phlogiston are
a few examples that I just came up with off the top of my head.

Let's stop right here and ask ourselves the following question. Given that
literally throughout all of humanity people have considered that they were right
about everything, and that they weren't, what are our chances for having it
right this time?

Personally, I would bet on that proverbial snowball in hell before considering
that *no seriously you guys, this time we've **totally** got it right*. But
maybe that's just me.

My last post was pretty hard on traditional philosophy. This one is about to get
harder on it, but might give you a little more insight into where I'm coming
from.

I can remember the exact moment when I gave up on philosophy-as-it-stands.
Certainly I had been doubtful of it for quite some time, but I hadn't yet given
up on it. The moment was when I was talking with an eminent philosopher at my
university, a man who is highly regarded in most of my philosophical circles for
being pragmatic about philosophy. A man known for applying scientific principles
to the study: if holding this idea won't change the way you live your life, then
what good is it?

Surely if there were anyone who were doing philosophy correctly, this man would
be a strong contender for the title.

Please forgive my hubris, but I was actually impressed by this man. That is,
until I sat down with him and began discussing Bayesianism[^1]. He disagreed
(vehemently, he said) with it, which is totally cool--it's not the most popular
of philosophies out there. But when I asked him *what specifically about it he
disagreed with*, he didn't have an answer. Thinking that maybe he had just
evaluated it previously and forgotten, I reminded him of a few of the big names
and concepts on the topic, and it became clear that he actually had no idea what
Bayesianism talks about.

...but he disagreed with it vehemently regardless.

Clearly, if there were an art to thinking, this was not what it looked like. If
you can immediately dismiss ideas without knowing anything about them, unless
your current beliefs are perfectly accurate, your beliefs are going to be wrong.

[^1]: Really super duper quick turbo introduction: uncertainty exists only as a
property of the human mind. Reality itself is never surprising--only relative to
incorrect human models about how it *should* work.



## III

Previously I had mentioned how daydreaming is a rudimentary form of what I've
been calling **Painting with Thoughts**. It's rudimentary in the same way that
a child randomly hitting keys on a piano is rudimentary music. Like, if you look
at it the right way. As the child's parent. It's not all that pleasurable for
other people to experience, except that it should be celebrated because it's the
first step toward [something much more monumental][liszt].

The reason that randomly hitting keys on a piano isn't musically appealing is
because it doesn't conform to our concept of **artistic autonomy**, which is to
say that there is no understanding of the rules behind why the art form works.
Music works because of how harmonics combine and how humans experience sound on
a psychological level. Fiction works because characters are believable and the
make-believe worlds have verisimilitude. I'm not quite ready to talk about what
the artistic autonomy of Painting with Thoughts is, but astute readers probably
already know the answer. If not, just hold tight. We'll get there.

I'm not saying that the rules of music theory should never be broken (and
likewise, the artistic autonomy of thinking), but I am saying that if you plan
on breaking the rules, you need to do it intentionally. If you're *not* breaking
the rules intentionally, you can only be breaking them out of ignorance[^2], and
that makes you look like a poseur at best, and a cheap hack at worst.

This intentionality is the difference between John Cage's [4'33"][433] and
silence. 4'33" is set in the context of music, and from there it breaks the
rules. Like seriously, it really breaks them. It takes delight in tearing the
rules asunder and pooping on them. 4'33" is completely and absolutely ridiculous
(it has timed movements for chrissake), but, as it turns out, John Cage is
actually a [really good composer when he tries][dreams]. Like, he's not just
a gimmick. This implies that he knows what he's doing, and that he *knew* what
he was doing when he composed a song consisting entirely of silence.

What I'm trying to say is that this context is key. You need to understand an
art form at some level before you can start working on your style. This is my
promise that there will be opportunities to develop your own personal style of
Painting with Thoughts, but a little patience is required lest we all look like
cheap hacks.

[^2]: Which, contrary to popular belief, is *not* bliss.

## IV

Unfortunately for us, traditional philosophy is the context under which we must
work, at least temporarily. This is the reason I keep talking about it, because
I think it misses the mark entirely of what it's trying to do, and I think it's
a corruption of the art I'm trying to share. I am attempting to break the rules,
but to do so I need to first prove that I know what I'm talking about, and so we
must take one final detour before we can finally begin to get to the real meat
of what Painting with Thoughts really looks like.

I would like to draw a (granted, relatively poor) metaphor here between
philosophy and popular music. To make it a DOUBLE METAPHOR, we can draw another
line between popular music and empty calories. Sure, it will fill you up when
you're hungry, but there's no real nutrients or sustenance to it. It feels like
it's filling a need, but it's not really. Popular music is made to be consumed,
rather than cherished. Sure it's kind of fun and catchy, but in 20 years nobody
is going to be studying how great a song "Call Me Maybe[^3]" was. In fact, I
suspect in 20 years, nobody who wasn't alive in 2012 will know what "Call Me
Maybe" is.

I'm not trying to beat up poor Carly Rae here, no, actually I think her music is
kind of fun and exactly what I need sometimes. What I'm trying to beat up is
traditional philosophy, which, despite having been studied for approximately
2500 years in its current form, hasn't grown in its entire lifetime anywhere
close to how much *any other subject* has grown in the last 50 years.

To me, this implies a fatal flaw. Surely after *all* this time, *someone* must
have gotten *somewhere*?

The problem, I think, is that being a philosopher is like being a pop artist.
It's a very prestigious job, and that's why most people seem to chase it. People
want to be rock-stars rather than make music, and they want to be philosophers
rather than actually improve the human experience.

Because really, if knowing great philosophy doesn't change your life, how can it
improve anything?

Now don't get me wrong, there's nothing intrinsically wrong with this mindset.
People are allowed to get up to whatever kinds of things they choose to get up
to for any reasons that they want, but personally this route doesn't appeal to
me. If I'm going to spend my time working on something, it damn well better have
some value--either intrinsically, or have at least taught me something in the
process--or otherwise I'm just wasting my time.

The art of thinking is just that: an art. Like artists chase their art because
they want to express themselves, we too should have similar aspirations.
Daydreaming is rudimentary in that it's just for entertainment purposes, but we
should strive for more than just mere entertainment. I'm not saying that the art
can't be fun, but it is entertaining in the way that a difficult project is fun.
It's a challenge--a chance to prove things to yourself. It's a steep learning
curve. It's an opportunity to create a manifestation of yourself, something to
pour your soul into.

If you only care about empty calories, then stick to daydreaming and commend
yourself anyway, because even this is a huge improvement over most of our modern
adult lives. Creativity in any form should be applauded.

But if you feel like I feel, if you have the hunger to create, the need to
self-express and the insatiable urge to understand all that can be understood,
then these empty calories will not, no, **can not** be enough to gratify our
curiosities.

It is for this reason, and this reason alone, that we must take on the colossal
task of reinventing normative human thought. If nothing will sate our hunger,
we will need to do it ourselves.

[^3]: Oh my god, was this song actually released two years ago? I couldn't think
of any music more contemporary, which might be my point exactly.
