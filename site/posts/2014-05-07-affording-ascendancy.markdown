## I

For the longest time, I found myself in a pretty serious existential pickle.
I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, but I knew that the longer
I took to figure it out, the further I'd be behind those who had already picked.
This makes intuitive sense; if everyone has the same amount of life, and you
waste two years before becoming a plumber, your neighbor who didn't waste two
years before becoming a plumber will always have two years of experience on you.
Assuming that you and your neighbor work the same amount, he will forever be the
better plumber.

Now I was pretty sure that I didn't want to be a plumber. I think it's a pretty
important job and I am happy that there are plumbers in the world, but my
interests were so varied that I was experiencing the Curse of Choice -- I had so
many options that I couldn't pick between them.

It took me about three years between acknowledging this was a problem and
figuring out what my plan for the future was. That's a long time, but
fortunately it only took me took me *two* years to come up with a solution.
That's two years wasted, but hey, it's better than wasting *three* years.

The solution to my existential pickle turns out to be pretty general and apply
often in life, especially when you have time with which you'd otherwise not know
what to do.

I call my solution "**Ascending**", not only because it's an appropriate label,
but also because it sounds frickin' awesome. Ascending is the process of
leveling-up when you're not otherwise occupied.

It goes a little like this.

Imagine your life is a choose-your-own-adventure book. It's probably not a hard
thing with which to come to grips. At any moment you have a set of actions you
can take, each of which has the potential to change how your story ends. Some
actions don't have much effect on the conclusion, but others are pretty pivotal
to the plot. Unfortunately for us, unlike the choose-your-own-adventure book, we
can't bookmark our last big choice and flip back to it if things go wrong. Our
actions in reality have more gravitas than in the book, and so we should pay
more attention to them.

In psychology, the options we know about at any given moment are called
**affordances**. When you walk into the sitting room with the intention of
relaxing your legs, and you see a stool, a recliner and a love-seat (all of
which are unoccupied), these seating options consist of your affordances for
sitting.

If you're anything like me, you probably had lots of issues successfully getting
through a choose-your-own adventure (to be honest, I don't think I ever survived
all the way through any of those Goosebumps ones). There was always a goal I was
trying to accomplish, and I knew what it was, but none of the options ever
seemed like they would get me there. I think this is a pretty good metaphor for
life: it's pretty hard to predict what the results of your actions will be the
further in time you need to predict.

What's worse is that any long-term goal is not a single choice, but an option
you need to take over and over. When I am working on a big personal software
project, each and every day I need to make a conscious decision to continue
working on it. More insidiously, I need to continually make the decision to *not
start other projects*, because I know from lots of experience that that's a good
way to lose focus on my current project.

An interesting question that is afforded by our metaphor of
life-as-a-choose-your-own-adventure is this: *if your life is a book, who's the
author*?

Remember our sitting room, and the hard decision you had to make about where to
sit? The way I presented the problem to you, it sounded like you only had three
options: the stool, the recliner, or the love seat. I apologize for being so
duplicitous, but I was actively trying to mislead you. You have more options
than the ones presented. What are they, you might ask? How about on the floor?

Pretty sneaky, huh? There's a lesson to be learned here, which is namely that
there are more options than you have affordances for (remember, an affordance is
an option you *know about* -- but there are still options you *don't know
about* or, in the sitting room example, *don't think about*). As a general
principle, if you can avoid the Curse of Choice, having more affordances is
better than having fewer, because it gives you more control over your life.
When you consider a long-term goal and realize that none of your current
affordances seem to help accomplish it, this is a sure sign that you *do not
have enough affordances*.

The author of your life-as-a-book is, unsurprisingly, you. If you want to be
awesome in this life, you are going to need to start writing your own
affordances at the bottom of your pages to turn to page 86 and pick up the sword
of +1 Obstacle-Ass-Kicking.

## III

In philosophy this concept is called "agency" -- the ability to take
responsibility for your life and act as an agent of accomplishing things.
Malcolm calls this "self-authorship". I don't disagree with either label, but
being told to "take responsibility" is kind of useless if you don't know where
to look to find it.

To that end, I want to concentrate on a certain aspect of agency: the ability to
acquire affordances. Remember, the more affordances we have, the better we
expect to be able to accomplish cool things.

So, the secret is to follow affordances you already have, which you expect will
lead to more affordances in the future. In our authorship metaphor, you should
probably attempt to get to the stationary store where you can buy a pen. Once
you have a pen by legitimate means, you can start writing new options at the
bottom of your pages. But writing by hand is slow, so the next step is to write
affordances that get you enough money to purchase a typewriter. The typewriter
is much faster, and now you can write more options in the same amount of time.
Now use your typewriter to get a computer, which you can use to write options
for you. For brevity's sake, I'll stop here, but it shouldn't be hard to
imagine going further with this example.

An isomorphic idea to this is that of capital reinvestment in economics. If you
can *afford* it (get it?), take your extra money and invest it with the intent of
getting more money later. Given smart investments and enough time, you should be
able to become infinitely wealthy via this strategy.

We want to cultivate the same strategy, except with affordances.

To introduce a lemma (an idea which is not very useful by itself, but which
*affords* bigger ideas), I want to define a new conceptual resource for you to
keep in mind. This resource is called "**Ascendancy**", and it is the money of
affordances. Ascendancy is a currency you can spend to purchase affordances that
you wouldn't otherwise have.

Our problem of finding affordances to acquire more affordances suddenly reduces
to *collecting as much Ascendancy as possible*. Just like how survival in
modern society reduces to *collect enough money to pay for rent and food*, we
have simplified getting awesome at life to *collecting enough Ascendancy to pay
for our goals to succeed*.

So, having a conceptual idea of what Ascendancy consists of is cool and all, but
what is it really? How do we go about collecting it? The first step is to search
for other resources we have that satisfy the definition of our lemma: we must be
able to spend it for affordances.

The first thing that comes to mind is *money*. Hey, that was easy, wasn't it? My
earlier example of spending money to survive satisfies our lemma. We can also
spend money on luxury goods: all else being equal, being rich is better than
being poor.

That's a boring example, though. Exactly zero people were surprised that having
more money is better than having less money. Let's look at some other
possibilities which satisfy our criterion for being Ascendancy:

* **Time/Energy** - obviously having more time/energy lets us do more things.
  A classical example of spending time is to trade it for money (via a job).
* **Charisma/Friends/Networks** - like it or not, knowing the right people is often
  a lot more important to success than merit alone. Friends are essentially the
  credit cards of Ascendancy.
* **Information/Knowledge** - almost by definition, increasing the things about
  which you are knowledgeable will increase your affordances (since they are
  *options you know about*).
* **Prestige/Reputation** - having people who trust you will afford you to do things
  that require trust from others. Being known as someone who gets things done
  will afford you more co-operation from others, etc.

Just like money, nothing on this list is particularly surprising. There are
almost certainly dozens of other examples of Ascendancy, but these are probably
sufficient for our purposes.

It's not a difficult concept, but it's mad useful. Once you get the hang of
finding good trades between forms of Ascendancy, you can start leveling-up in
life *crazy fast*. This is the entire mechanic behind my
[success in 2013][2013]. Ascendancy is the scaffolding that allows you to reach
the great heights necessary for big goals.

Cool. So why am I talking about all of this when I've been blogging in
excruciating detail about [Painting with Thoughts][painting], you might be
wondering? Our conceptual painting framework turns out to be not only
a beautiful art-form, but also, coincidentally, *the best means of accumulating
Ascendancy*. Unfortunately, there's a lot of material to cover before we can
actually *prove* that, but we'll get there one day.

Next week we're going to start talking about how one actually goes about
Painting with Thoughts, but just because we haven't developed our *best means of
acquiring Ascendancy* doesn't mean you can't start collecting it in the
meantime.
