I love love love this quote.

I look why some people are better at certain cognitive tasks than others as
largely a *software* issue, rather than a *hardware* issue. Without any science
backing me up, but from the way that things *feel*, I'd like to make some
claims.

We're all born with the equivalent of a Pentium 4 processor for our brains, and
like, what, a gig of ram? More or less, our biological bits are probably pretty
similar. In the way that your fingers might be longer than mine, but they still
contain tendons and can bend and pick up stuff, our brains are probably mostly
indistinguishable at a biological level (at least at birth.)

But that doesn't explain why our brains exhibit different characteristics of
things they're capable of doing. For example, I'm pretty OK at learning math,
but I understand that this is a relatively rare phenotype.

The claim is that our understanding comes [primarily in the form of
metaphors][metaphors]; we draw metaphors between things we have an intuition of
to things we don't, and we use that bridge to help interpret and understand the
new topic.

[metaphors]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34459.Metaphors_We_Live_By

If this is in fact a true claim, it means we can gain intuition about new topics
by drawing metaphors to ones for which we already have an understanding. I would
make the assertion that this is the core reason behind why thins come more
easily to some than others -- that already possess relevant mental machinery to
cross the gaps.

There's a quote that comes to mind:

> Like all artisans, a blacksmith needs tools, but—according to an old (indeed
> almost extinct) observation—blacksmiths are unique in that they make their own
> tools.

> -Daniel C. Dennett, Intuition Pumps

Like blacksmiths, I would suggest that our minds as they exist today are the
result of having built and rebuilt our own tools for thinking (aka the metaphors
through which we see the world.) As we learn more and more things, our
collection of useful metaphors likely becomes more and more unique, which shapes
not only the way we understand the world, but also our tools for deconstructing
and learning new things.

There is an important realization here, if true, which comes in two forms of the
same thought: our minds and cogitative skills are malleable, and that we can
exploit such a fact if we so choose.

A couple of corollaries fall out of this. The first is that if we want to learn
something completely outside of our area of expertise, it might be fruitful to
attempt to analyze it in terms of things we already understand. This, for
example, is why I've [attempted to systematize the core rules of music][music]
as a computer program. I know how to program computers and explicitly how to
think about designing them, but I have no such tools for music. I won't say that
this exercise has made me into a jazz pianist, but it's certainly given me a few
intuitions behind why, e.g. scales are what they are.

The other corollary is that it can be beneficial to seek out explicit and
widely-applicable mental models. Some that come to mind that I invoke quite
often are:

* Natural Selection -- things that are better at "surviving" or "reproducing"
    will outperform things that do this less well. Resulting generations of this
    thing will exhibit more of their ancestor's qualities than the qualities of
    competing things that died out. Natural selection explains evolution of the
    species, but also viral media, contemporary thought, and our interpretation
    of history (among many, many other things).
* Nash Equilibria -- a point at which things become stuck, because there are no
    incentives for anyone participating to change their mind. Nash Equilibria
    explain a lot of world politics, where bureaucracy comes from, stagnancy of
    human relationships, strategies for board games, and all sorts of other
    interesting things.
* Pareto Principle -- the 80/20 rule: most of the results of something come
    from doing only a small fraction of the work. You can observe this
    everywhere, from the grading scheme in university, to launching an MVP as a
    startup, to most civilizations' punishments for theft. More generally, the
    Pareto principle is a Pareto principling of the [Taylor series][taylor].
* Efficient Market Hypothesis -- capitalism is not stupid (in the sense of not
    being intelligent enough to capitalize on good opportunities), and that
    things are worth what people are willing to pay for them. This suggests that
    that great idea you have about how easy it would be in order to fix
    something might not be such a great idea after all -- or else it would have
    already been done. There are, of course, [caveats to this][inadequate].
* [Expected Value / Value of Information][voi] -- we can put an explicit
    monetary value on how beneficial a course of action or piece of information
    would be, and, because of the Pareto principle, we won't be *too* wrong
    despite just making up some numbers. Exceptionally useful for evaluating
    choices with significant potential long-term repercussions.
* Strategy and Tactics -- the distinction between actions that produce favorable
    long-term results, vs those that produce short-term results. Helpful for
    analyzing a potential course of action based on what you want to accomplish
    and the timeline over which you care.
* Capital -- the idea that things we usually pay no attention to are in fact
    resources, and can be used as such. For example, you've probably heard of
    political capital: how much sway you have in some sort of organization, but
    if you spend your influence on something controversial, you'll have less of
    it to go around the next time. Other types of capital include career
    capital, social capital, attention span, and will-power.
* Exponential Gains -- doing things that can build upon themselves to produce
    bigger things. Exponential gain is a model for acquiring something
    significantly larger than you could have ever built yourself one brick at a
    time. Being able to spot exponential gains (and subsequently capitalize on
    them) is likely the most important skill you will ever develop. Examples
    include investing money, investing in skills, really, anything that uses the
    term "investment."

As a shameless self promotion, I also [maintain an archive of every quote I've
read that has caused me to stop and think for a second][books]. I consider these
moments to be tiny steps towards building a new lens under which to view the
world. That being said, I find it an invaluable resource for myself, and if I
can offer you some unsolicited advice, would suggest you take up a similar habit
if you don't already.

The key takeaway from all of this is that your mind is better considered as a
blacksmith's shop than as a pristine sculpture. The blacksmith constructs his
own tools, with which he can construct better refined goods and even more
precise tools. Your mind isn't a precious artifact passed down from generation
to generation whose flaws and imperfections you have no choice but to deal with.
It's a living, breathing thing, with the capabilities to shape itself into
whatever you want it to be.

So long as you're willing to devote a great deal of time and study and work and
thinking and mathematics and so on.
