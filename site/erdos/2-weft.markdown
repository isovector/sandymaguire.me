Weft is a GraphQL implementation for Haskell, based around the idea that Haskell
types should be powerful enough to encode everything you need to generate a GQL
server. It uses HKDs extensively, to reuse the same data structure from
everything from data, IO resolvers, parsed queries, and responses.

Also, Jonathan and Claire took me out to the art museum where we saw totem poles
built out of sports bags. We had great philosophical chats (he is a philosopher
by training!)
