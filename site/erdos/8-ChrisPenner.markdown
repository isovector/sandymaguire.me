Literally the first thing we did, Chris Penner sat me down and ran me through
optics. "They're just `traverse` in different pants," he said. A few hours
later, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp on the whole idea.

We found it a little hard to find things to collaborate on; Chris' big project
these days is his Lens book, which is obviously not something I can contribute
much to. But we had an excellent time hanging out, chatting about the ecosystem,
and how to fix the problems in the community.

Also, Chris is an amazing musician. We broke into the music store and had a few
jam sessions. I came away feeling inspired by the things he taught me on piano,
and I can't wait to get my hands on one again to give the new ideas a go.
