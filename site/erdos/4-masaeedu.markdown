Asad and I met on the University of Toronto campus. We were planning on
infiltrating a lecture hall, but they were all locked up. He showed me his
encoding of all user interfaces via `(u -> m ()) -> s -> v`, and walked me
through how it actually works --- pretty dang cool. We grabbed coffee, and Asad
saved me a few hundred bucks per year in AWS costs. He walked me through some of
the intuitions behind how lenses work, and it was an excellent time.
