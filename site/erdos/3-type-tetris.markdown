Ben and I met up for dinner, and spent it discussing why Haskell hasn't taken
over the world, and what it would need to be in order to do so. We then
meandered down to his office, hung out on the roof on a Friday night, and coded
up the most type-astronaut version of Tetris we could think of. The board is a
`Store` comonad, with gravity and movement being implemented as `extend`s. A lot
of the core implementation got finished, but the game aspect sadly not.
