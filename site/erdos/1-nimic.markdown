Nimic is a tiny macro language, with no built-in syntax or operational
semantics. I wrote a [little blog post on it][nimic].

Together, David and I designed the language, wrote a parser and the macro
substitution, and a "compiler." He added the `bash` primitive, and I worked on
the interactive stepper.

Also, David took me out for a pottery class, and to the computer scientists'
dinner. We almost managed to burn down his house with an explosive barbecue
incident.
