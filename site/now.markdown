## Roadtrip!

With the successful launch of
[`polysemy`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dHFOjcK6pA) out of the way, it's
time for some much-needed vacation time.

My girlfriend Virginie and I are off on a two-week-long roadtrip to Halifax. We
don't really have a plan, other than to take every opportunity to wing it. My
last long roadtrip was from San Francisco to Denver, but it was mostly a B-line
trying to get there as fast as possible.

And before that? A trip from my hometown in Terrace, BC all the way to Waterloo,
ON. About 6000km that my dad and I rubber-hoofed it across the country. We spent
the entire time ahead of a storm, which would catch up with us each night as we
set up camp. It was a miserable camping trip, but I loved hanging out with my
dad.

Anyway. This trip. Virginie knows lots of people along the way, so we're
planning on meeting up with them and getting into trouble. Also lots of hiking
and, since it's Atlantic Canada, lots of sea food.

I'm intending to stay out of the spotlight for a bit; I've set up a vacation
responder on my email, so there's no pressure to stay in touch with anyone. I
hope to run into Halifax's functional programming community, but besides that,
nothing. There are a few projects I want to wrap up, but they're not *my*
projects, so hopefully I won't have any issues disassociating with the work.

Apparently I'm a bit of a workaholic. This vacation will be good for me.
