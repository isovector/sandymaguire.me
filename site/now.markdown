Oops --- I forgot to update my "now" page for over two years! I put it into my
calendar to remember to update weekly, but we'll see if that actually happens.

The biggest update is that Erin and I are engaged! In a daring show of love, I
moved all the furniture out of our apartment and screwed with the breaker box so
we had to light candles. Then we wandered around a visual representation of our
relationship, complete with chat logs, photos and journal entries. She said yes!

In other news, we're leaving Victoria in three short weeks, off to travel the
world. And we've started selling things already, which is nice on the
not-being-stressed front, but clearly premature. Everything went SO QUICKLY and
now we don't have any furniture and the place is in shambles.

Leaving Victoria is bittersweet. It hasn't been ALL THAT MUCH FUN during cov,
but as of last week covid is over, and I just feel like I'm starting to find my
people. I've put together more community in the last three weeks than in the
two years before that, which is good for a lonely soul, but it's all just in
time to leave.

Part of that community has been building the local FP meetup. It's been a few
months in the making, and we had a major breakthrough last night --- seven
people, all of whom had fun and promised to come back! My peer pressuring skills
have finally come in handy for more than getting people out to karaoke; turns
out, they're useful for bullying cool people into building community with me.
