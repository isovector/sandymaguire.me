In an attempt to hyper-charge how good I am at music, I'm currently learning,
recording and [publishing][soundcloud] one song per day. I'm about a week deep
into this project, and it's amazing how much better I've gotten in such a short
time. I mean, you can *actually hear it.* Though I guess that's sort of the
point.

Additionally, I've been meeting up with lots of cool new people lately. I'm not
sure why, but all of a sudden, people have been reaching out. And it's
*fantastic.* I've noticed that the calibre of interactions I've been having with
these people is significantly better than those with whom I meet more
organically. So if you're in the Ottawa area (or in San Francisco), feel free to
[reach out!](mailto:sandy@sandymaguire.me)

Speaking of which, I'm going to be in San Francisco in a few weeks (Feb 22 --
March 3). I hated SF when I lived there, but my god am I excited to be going
back. For all of its problems, San Francisco sure has its fair share of
inspiring humans.

Oh, and I'm also writing a typechecker plugin for Haskell that I'm describing
[like Napster but for instances.][wide]
