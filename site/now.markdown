Another year, another "now" page.

Life has been picking up steam lately. All of a sudden I find myself writing a
book, being in pre-production for another, planning a wedding, dealing with the
influx of PhD programs that would love to have me, building cool new technology
at work, automating our smart home, putting a talk together for a conference,
and physically jumping over lots of static structures.

In some sense, it's exhausting, but also an exhilarating change of pace from the
last few years. It's *nice* to be busy --- especially with interesting projects.

The stuff I'm most excited about right now is parkour. I unlocked something
inside myself this week: the realization that I haven't been trying very hard
thus far. I've been managing to do OK on raw talent and a lifetime of climbing
things. And I realize I've just been sorta coasting at parkour: trying things,
but not trying *that hard.* And more interestingly, not even noticing that I
wasn't trying that hard. But something unlocked, and I was able to give it
significantly more effort than I had been previously. And it's got me wondering
if I've been phoning it in everywhere in my life?

That's not a depressing thought; it's an inspiring one.

It looks like grad school is a go. I have at least two offers, and I suspect
at least one more is in the pipes. That's wildly exciting, and now means I need
to do the hard work of picking a program. The tradeoffs are widely incomparable,
between compensation, adviser fit, short-term location, long-term location (by
the end of the program I'm going to be nearly 40!), commute times, and
competativeness, to name a few. I don't really know what my strategy is going to
be, but I suspect it will involve math.

Ironically, I haven't yet written about my new year's goal of being a **Man of
Action,** which is more of a theme than a goal. But the idea is that whenever I
see an opportunity for action, I should aspire to take it. It's been a really
great change of pace: from sending back food, to standing up for my right to sit
down, to returning expired yogurt. Lots of trivial inconveniences that a
less-assertive person (like me a few months ago) would accept and grumble about,
that instead I am dealing with. And I guess I'm also updating my now page. Look
at that; action all around.
