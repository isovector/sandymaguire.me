Vietnam. I'm not sure how I ended up here, but I'm hot on the trail of a few
intensely-burning and unsurprisingly wildly-short relationships. I'm taking a
sabbatical from programming due to serious burnout, and am instead playing music
and taking care of myself.

The plan is to slowly meander my way down to Koh Lanta, where I spent six lovely
weeks. It's the only place that's felt like "home" in a long time, so it seems
like the sort of place I should get back to.

Output-wise, I'm currently working on some 2020 goals, and putting together a
retrospective of the last decade. The goals are tentatively to learn how to love
vegetables, find a location to settle, fill my passport, go on more adventures,
and broaden my employable skills.

Maybe I should add "update my *now* page more often than every six months" too
that list.
