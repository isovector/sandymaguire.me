I've decided to leave Ottawa, to focus full time on my [Erdos Project][erdos].
The idea is to travel around the world, sleeping on Haskeller's couches,
inspiring them to bunk off work and program with me nonstop for a few days.
Rinse and repeat for as long as I can handle sleeping on couches.

The last few days have been a flurry of Kijiji, Craigslist and Facebook selling.
I've never used any of these services to buy anything, so I'm continually amazed
at how thirsty people are for *stuff.* As someone who practices inbox
zero, getting emails stresses me the fuck out. It's been a hard few days, but
I've now gotten rid of almost everything I own. I'll only be taking one
carry-on-sized suitcase. It looks small, but my god, having such a constraint
really forces you to pare down to the necessities.

All of this is scary, but I feel more alive than I have in years. As far as
strategies go, I think that moving towards feeling alive can't possibly be a bad
one.

More when I know it.
