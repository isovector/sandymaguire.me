I am really awful at this "now" stuff. Here is some "then" stuff to make up the
difference:

Erin and I landed a great place in our desired neighborhood. It was super easy,
barely an inconvenience to find. Nice. I've been trying to get socially oriented
in Vancouver, and making good progress, but everyone has JOBS which means they
can only hang out in the evenings, which dramatically reduces the time I can be
social. Oh well.

Some friends and I are attempting to formalize probability/utility theory in
Agda. They have a longer term goal of generalizing it to quantum amplitudes, but
for me, it's just fun hacking on math stuff with the homies. It's made me very
aware of just how much math/Agda I know, which I think might turn into a
cool NaNoWriMo project. Stay tuned.

Besides that, I'm officially employed again. Wire liked my work, and re-extended
my contract. It's been lovely having some external structure. Wire gets two days
a week, and there is some talk of a few other projects that might want some of
my days as well. Working again is neat; it's not full time or anything, but nice
to not need to worry about the bills, and to have enough agency on projects that
I don't get bored.

The remainder of my time is (attempting) to do some research in a grad-student
capacity. I'm not in the program yet, but admissions haven't started and I
thought it might be nice to sync up with a professor to see if we work well
together. I think a PhD is in the cards, but it's a bit scary because last time
didn't go so well. Never trying again I think is the wrong lesson to take away
from failures though, so I will persevere even if it's unpleasant.

My search engine is happily chugging away still. I haven't worked on it much
in the last six weeks. At some point the index got too big to be useful, which
is a fascinating turn of events, and really one I should write about.
