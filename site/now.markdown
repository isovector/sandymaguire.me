## Productive as Heck

I'm halfway through my first [Ultraworking
Pentathlon](https://www.ultraworking.com/pentathlon), which is about as cool as
it sounds. The idea is to spend 16 days being hyper-focused on hitting five key
habits every day---planning, sleep, nutrition, fitness and working on important
things. I was expecting to coast through it, but it's been harder than I was
anticipating.

My "most important work" these days is threefold:


### Writing a computer program that will kill LaTeX.

After finishing my [book][thinking], I realized how terrible the writing process
is when done in LaTeX. It's pretty good at getting a pretty document up and
running in a few minutes, but then falls victim to Ruby-on-Rails-Syndrome where
everything is fucking magic and nothing works if the default magic isn't exactly
what you want. Instead, what I want is a denotational,
Turing--Complete-from-the-get-go, shut-up-and-let-me-write experience that lets
you mark "what you mean" in the document, and figure out how to present that
later.

### Teaching myself how to play jazz music

as guided by the encyclopedic (if lacking in pedagogical skills) [Mark Levine's
The Jazz Theory Book][jazz].  But learning jazz music isn't just the goal. I
also want to do it *fast*.  Most extremely difficult professions can be taught
in a matter of years, but getting amazing at music usually seems to take
decades. I think we can do better, and am willing to put my money where my mouth
is.

### Writing a book on how to learn music quickly.

The synthesis of my other two important fields of work. Learning how to learn
difficult things quickly isn't helpful for anyone if I don't pass on the
knowledge, and book-typesetting software is useless if nobody's written a book
in it.
