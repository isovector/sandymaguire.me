Lots of exciting stuff is going on! Erin and I just got back to Canada after a
long (but excellent) eleven weeks of traveling. The travel day was an intense 27
hours, including a full-speed RUN through Toronto Pearson.

But anyway. We're now in Vancouver, and, amazingly, also in possession of
housing. We came home early from our trip to secure a place to live before Erin
starts work in September, and the Vancouver housing market is a notoriously
difficult thing to break into. The day we landed we were out at viewings, and,
despite a few mishaps (being offered, and almost TAKING, a place we didn't apply
for,) have worked everything out now.

The weekend is being spent at the Vancouver Folk Fest, a three day music
festival of mostly Canadian artists. A lot of the music has been good (but
rarely WOW), except that we saw the New Pornographers last night who are looking
old but have still got the magic. The remainder of today will also be at the
Folk Fest, after which I am ready and excited to GET TO WORK.

Getting to work means investing myself in the city. Now that covid is over and
that I'm going to be here for a few years minimum, it's worth making friends,
finding activities, and building community. This is the stuff I've been yearning
to do for three years now, and having it in the back of my head has been the
hardest part of traveling --- the aching to be settle somewhere and making the
most of my time there.

I've prepared a list of activities to take up, groups to join, and old friends
to reach out to. Also some new skills to learn, and maybe a new search engine to
build. It's going to be a busy, but delightful time.
