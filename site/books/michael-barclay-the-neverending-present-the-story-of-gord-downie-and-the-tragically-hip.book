Book {title = "The Never-Ending Present: The Story of Gord Downie and the Tragically Hip", author = Just "Michael Barclay", rating = Just "2", review = Just "This is without a doubt the worst biography I've ever read. It calls itself \"the story of Gord Downie and the Tragically Hip,\" but it's not really. It's goes on and on interminably with anecdotes only tangentially related to the band: <br /><br />\"Gord Downie died from cancer, here's sixteen pages about other, completely unrelated, musicians who also died from cancer.\" <br /><br />\"Here's an entire chapter about the internal politics of the record labels, and how they affected other bands' records, but not how it affected the Hip's.\" <br /><br />\"That one time I went to a Tragically Hip show.\" <br /><br />\"Is the Tragically Hip really a /Canadian/ band? Or just a band from Canada?\" <br /><br />And lots of other banal shit like that. Skip The Never-Ending Present, it's clearly a cash-grab on the sensationalism after Downie's death."}
