Book {title = "The Five People You Meet in Heaven", author = Just "Mitch Albom", rating = Just "3", review = Just "I read this on the recommendation of a good friend. It was fine---gripping enough to pull me through it, and short enough to have been read in a day. While there might be some chicken-soup-for-the-soul stuff here for someone, that person wasn't me. It's a nice reminder that nobody is an island and that being a bitter, curmudgeonly old man is no way to live your life. Also, go give your dad a call."}
