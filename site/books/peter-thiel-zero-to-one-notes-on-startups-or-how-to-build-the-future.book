Book {title = "Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future", author = Just "Peter Thiel", rating = Just "4", review = Just "This is a pretty good read! It was hard to put down---I devoured it in less than 24 hours.<br /><br />Thiel has some poignant arguments in Zero to One. There's a lot of good takeaways for people who want to change the world and shape the future. But there's also chapter 10, which focuses on ways in which companies fail. This was particularly interesting to me in that it perfectly described my last company---we all knew it was fundamentally dysfunctional, but Thiel somehow managed to describe *almost every single problem we faced.*<br /><br />I get the impression that Thiel knows what he's talking about. Combined with an inspiring message, it's worth your time."}
