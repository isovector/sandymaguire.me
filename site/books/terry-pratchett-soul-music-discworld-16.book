Book {title = "Soul Music (Discworld #16)", author = Just "Terry Pratchett", rating = Just "2", review = Just "This is one of my least favorite Discworld books. Pratchett uses this literary device where he describes situations for far too long without telling you what's going on. Usually it works, but it completely fell flat for me in this book. I spent the last 30% having no idea what was going on. Maybe it's that I don't have enough knowledge of rock'n'roll imagery, but that doesn't mean it /works/."}
