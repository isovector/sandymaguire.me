Book {title = "Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (Dirk Gently #1)", author = Just "Douglas Adams", rating = Just "4", review = Just "This book takes its time in world-building, and sets up a truly magnificent mystery! And then it all goes to shambles when [SPOILERS] a fucking alien ghost did it. [/SPOILERS] What a stupid ending! I have the suspicion that this book would be 2x as good if it had been cowritten with someone who had said \"No, Doug, let's not put aliens into our great murder mystery story.\" But not if that person were Max Landis.<br /><br />I read this book as a kid, and vaguely enjoyed reading it. I reread it now after having watched a bit of MAX LANDIS' TV ADOPTION OF DIRK GENTLY. And man, the book is so much better. I know that I'm supposed to be talking about the book and not about Max Landis, but jesus that guy is a hack fraud. How could he have possibly messed up such a great book into such forgettable TV?<br /><br />Anyway anyway, with that in mind, I guess the book is actually pretty good! Or at least, so much better than it might have been in the hands of someone else. I dunno. Go read it I guess."}
