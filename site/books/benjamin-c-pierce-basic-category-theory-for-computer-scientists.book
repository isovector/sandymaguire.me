Book {title = "Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists", author = Just "Benjamin C. Pierce", rating = Just "3", review = Just "Terse. Maybe too terse, but a lot of my issues would have been resolved had I realized there was an appendix of notation at the back of the book. Serves as a pretty solid introduction to category theory, but provides absolutely no indication as to *why one might want to know category theory*. The treatment is primarily for organizing ones thoughts about abstract structures rather than actually working with them. The book very briefly mentions representability, with no discussion of the Yoneda lemma (which I understand to be one of the more useful parts of category theory).<br /><br />I read this as part of MIRI's recommended reading list."}
