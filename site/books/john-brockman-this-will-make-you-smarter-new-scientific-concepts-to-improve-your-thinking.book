Book {title = "This Will Make You Smarter: New Scientific Concepts to Improve Your Thinking", author = Just "John Brockman", rating = Just "3", review = Just "This book had a few conceptual gems in it, but at a low enough density to not make it worthwhile. It's clear that a large number of essayists are writing about topics to signal looking smart, rather than to actually help you in any way. Don't waste your time."}
