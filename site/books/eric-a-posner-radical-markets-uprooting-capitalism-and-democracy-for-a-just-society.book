Book {title = "Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society", author = Just "Eric A. Posner", rating = Just "4", review = Just "This is an excellent book full of well-designed mechanisms for finding good Nash equilibria in society. From taxing possessions based on how valuable their owners consider them (and being required to sell them at that price if someone asks,) to a quadratic voting scheme for balancing the weight of the many against the passion of the few, this book nails lots of weird ideas for what life could be like. But of course people are too risk-adverse to try anything of the nature, and so we'll be stuck with the status quo until the collapse of society."}
