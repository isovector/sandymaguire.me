Book {title = "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin", author = Just "Benjamin Franklin", rating = Just "3", review = Just "What a neat guy! There's a lot to say here about the value of honesty and industriousness. The book is feel-good chicken soup for the soul and the first 65% of this book is utterly fantastic. You should go read it now. Go!<br /><br />And then it gets boring and starts talking more about events than about the man himself. The ending is unsatisfying. Blue-balled by Benjamin Franklin again."}
