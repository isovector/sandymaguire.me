Book {title = "The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made", author = Just "Greg Sestero", rating = Just "4", review = Just "I read this on a flight, and it made for an entertaining journey. If you're a fan of The Room, this reads exactly like the behind-the-scenes you always hoped existed. It's chalked full of amazing Wiseauisms and maintains a Very Funny level all the way through. I'm going to need to watch The Room again in light of having read this book to keep an eye out for all the gaffs.<br /><br />All jokes aside though, Sestero obviously has a soft-spot in his heart for Wiseau, and he brilliantly portrays everyone's favorite punching-bag exceptionally sympathetically. This book has enough Feels to have taught me something about friendship.<br /><br />If you're interested, here are the quotes I liked from the book:<br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sandymaguire.me/books/greg-sestero-and-tom-bissell-the-disaster-artist.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sandymaguire.me/books/greg-ses...</a>"}
