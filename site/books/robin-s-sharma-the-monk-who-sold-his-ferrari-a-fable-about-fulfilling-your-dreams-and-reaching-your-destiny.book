Book {title = "The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari: A Fable About Fulfilling Your Dreams and Reaching Your Destiny", author = Just "Robin S. Sharma", rating = Just "2", review = Just "There is lots of good advice in this book, but the writing is absolutely atrocious. The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari would would be significantly improved by getting rid of the Mary Sue dialogue and instead just being a no-nonsense nonfiction book in the vein of The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People.<br /><br />I can't give it 1 star in good conscience, but I wish I could."}
