Book {title = "How to Lie with Statistics", author = Just "Darrell Huff", rating = Just "1", review = Just "I bought this because I though it was like \"how to do p-hacking\" when in fact it is \"what is the difference between a median and a mean\" and \"make sure the bottom of the graph isn't cut off.\" It's a book that hasn't aged well, written in an era where presumably nobody had been exposed to statistics before. Don't waste your time or your money."}
