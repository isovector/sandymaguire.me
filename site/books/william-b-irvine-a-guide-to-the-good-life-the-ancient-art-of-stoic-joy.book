Book {title = "A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy", author = Just "William B. Irvine", rating = Just "5", review = Just "This is a fantastic, highly-actionable book that you won't regret reading. Insofar as it's a guide to the good life, it boils down to a few high-level principles:<br /><br />* Be happy with what you've got<br />* Don't worry about things you can't change<br />* Strive to become stronger by intentionally putting yourself into uncomfortable situations<br /><br />They're great high-level goals, and the remainder of the book is tactics for achieving them (and some boring history stuff.)<br /><br />This book is so good that I'll buy you a copy---even if I don't know you :) Just ask!<br /><br />"}
