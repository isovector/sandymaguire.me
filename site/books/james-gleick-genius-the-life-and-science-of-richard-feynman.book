Book {title = "Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman", author = Just "James Gleick", rating = Just "4", review = Just "It's a great account of Feynman, and comes off feeling like less of a facade than Surely You're Joking or his other autobiographical works. It's not a life-changing book by any account, but it's a fascinating read for any researcher; in my opinion, the history presented in the book is completely paled by the glimpses we get into the governing dynamics of Feynman's mind.<br /><br />You're not going to learn any science here, but you might get an inkling into how to actually do science. And that's a wonderful thing."}
