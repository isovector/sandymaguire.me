Book {title = "The Jazz Language: A Theory Text for Jazz Composition and Improvisation", author = Just "Dan Haerle", rating = Just "3", review = Just "This book has the same problems every book on music seems to have: a lot of \"a dominant 7 chord looks like this\" and then a big chart of how to reharmonize what with what. Which is to say it's probably really helpful if you have a specific question you want answered, but falls flat on the topic of \"how do I learn this stuff?\" and \"what are the most important pieces here?\" As such, I'd say that this book is useless to an amateur, self-taught musician."}
