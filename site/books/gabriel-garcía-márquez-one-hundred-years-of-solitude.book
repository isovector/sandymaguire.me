Book {title = "One Hundred Years of Solitude", author = Just "Gabriel Garc\237a M\225rquez", rating = Just "4", review = Just "More like 100 years of reading, am I right? While I loved this book, it struck me as far too dense, and as a result, my reading sessions were very short to avoid overstimulation. I read this on the suggestion of everyone whose tastes I have come to appreciate; most of them described it as their favorite book, and while it was good, I wouldn't nominate it as mine. I can see why it's a classic, and I'm happy I read it, but I doubt it will see a second reading."}
