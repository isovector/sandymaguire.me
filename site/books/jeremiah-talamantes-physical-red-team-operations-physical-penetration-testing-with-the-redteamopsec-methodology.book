Book {title = "Physical Red Team Operations: Physical Penetration Testing with the REDTEAMOPSEC Methodology", author = Just "Jeremiah Talamantes", rating = Just "1", review = Just "Terrible. I was expecting a fun book full of cool spy stuff, and instead got a boring treatise on how to set up Microsoft Word documents for your customers, and how to deal with customer relations while doing pen testing. The actual spy stuff consists of \"use a carpet to get over barbed wire fence\", \"use a big mylar sheet stretched over a canvas to defeat motion sensors\", and \"wear pieces of carpet over your shoes.\"<br /><br />So what do we get? Unhelpful and tortured acronyms like REDTEAMOPSEC, where, for example, the E stands for \"Engage in Reconnaissance.\" Yeah, that's memorable."}
