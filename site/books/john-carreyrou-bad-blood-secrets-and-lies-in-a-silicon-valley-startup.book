Book {title = "Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup", author = Just "John Carreyrou", rating = Just "3", review = Just "The first half is dull, describing in excruciating detail a shitty work environment. But then the author (and LOTS of lawyers) gets personally involved, and I found myself caring again. I wouldn't recommend this book, but I also wouldn't slap it out of a stranger's hands if I saw them reading it."}
