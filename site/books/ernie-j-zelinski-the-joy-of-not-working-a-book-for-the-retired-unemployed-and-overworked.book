Book {title = "The Joy of Not Working: A Book for the Retired, Unemployed, and Overworked", author = Just "Ernie J. Zelinski", rating = Just "1", review = Just "I got about half way through this book before realizing it hadn't actually given me any concrete suggestions about what to do with my time. A lot of it was \"you TOO can live a great retired life!\" but never got around to telling me how to do it. Just how great it would be when I did! Maybe the book gets better at the end, but I realized I didn't trust the author enough to get anything of value out of it."}
