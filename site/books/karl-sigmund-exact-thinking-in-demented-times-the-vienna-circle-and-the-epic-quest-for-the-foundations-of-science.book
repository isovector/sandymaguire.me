Book {title = "Exact Thinking in Demented Times: The Vienna Circle and the Epic Quest for the Foundations of Science", author = Just "Karl Sigmund", rating = Just "1", review = Just "Life's too short for lots of things, and this book is one of them. It doesn't get around to explaining what the vienna circle was, or why I should care. There are some amusing anecdotes about some neat people, but the majority of it is banal discussions of their early lives, the girls they dated, and such blither. What's worse is Sigmund is an English professor, and needs to prove it by writing in a style so affected it actually pained me to read."}
