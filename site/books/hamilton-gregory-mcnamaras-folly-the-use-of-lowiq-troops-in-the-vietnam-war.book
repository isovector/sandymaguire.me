Book {title = "McNamara's Folly: The Use of Low-IQ Troops in the Vietnam War", author = Just "Hamilton Gregory", rating = Just "3", review = Just "The first three parts are quite good, describing the personal account of the author and his experience with the low-IQ section of the US milliary. After that, the rest of the book is just short, disorganized anecdotes from people he interviewed years later. There's a lot of \"not his real name\" and \"he declined to give specifics,\" which combined with the fact that these anecdotes simply rehash the author's experiences, don't lend much. It's an interesting read, but there weren't many takeaways other than \"don't let idiots handle grenades.\""}
