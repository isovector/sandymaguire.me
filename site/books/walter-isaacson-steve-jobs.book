Book {title = "Steve Jobs", author = Just "Walter Isaacson", rating = Just "4", review = Just "It's pretty good! I found myself not all that intrigued by Jobs after he stopped doing engineering, but my god is there a lot of good material here. It comes in terms of negotiating strategies, and in inspiration from having a single-minded artistic focus. Jobs is undeniably an asshole, but the book paints him sympathetically and it's engaging the whole way through."}
