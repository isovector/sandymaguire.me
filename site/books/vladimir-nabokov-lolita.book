Book {title = "Lolita", author = Just "Vladimir Nabokov", rating = Just "3", review = Just "Ehh. The first half was engaging and held my interest, but I found myself not caring by the end. It's a meandering story told by an obviously mad man, which isn't exactly a recipe for meaningful prose. I suspect there are lots of little treasures to be found in the writing qua writing, but on the whole, I found myself bored and being excited for Lolita to be over."}
