Book {title = "The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements", author = Just "Eric Hoffer", rating = Just "5", review = Just "I found myself continually wondering why the book had nothing to say about the current social justice movement; it was so spot on about everything, I figured it had to have been written recently. If you consider 60 years ago to be \"recent\", I guess that's true.<br /><br />This book doesn't have a lot of good things to say about human nature, nor is it very happy, but I found myself completely enthralled. By far the best book I've read in the last few years."}
