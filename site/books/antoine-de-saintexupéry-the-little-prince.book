Book {title = "The Little Prince", author = Just "Antoine de Saint-Exup\233ry", rating = Just "2", review = Just "Everyone seems to love this book. I don't.<br /><br />It's ok. There's a nice section where the prince makes friends with a fox. I liked that part! But I didn't understand what message the book was trying to tell me. \"Don't become an adult\" maybe? Possibly \"adults are boring and care about stupid things?\" There's definitely an anti-adult sentiment, but that's not particularly actionable. <br /><br />The book argues these points through a bunch of caricatures --- there's a king who \"rules\" nobody, and a banker who \"owns\" the universe. I guess the point is that believing something doesn't make it so? Or it's a bad allegory for \"you also need other people?\" Or something. In short, the storytelling is muddled, and the rest of it isn't charming enough to make up for it.<br /><br />I'm not sure it's the book's fault, but my copy had some egregious english grammar. Maybe it was a bad translation, or a garbled ebook or something, but it was enough to frequently break my suspension of disbelief."}
