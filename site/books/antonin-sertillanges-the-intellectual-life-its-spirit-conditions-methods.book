Book {title = "The Intellectual Life: Its Spirit, Conditions, Methods", author = Just "Antonin Sertillanges", rating = Just "4", review = Just "Pretty OK! It's half manual for structuring one's life as an intellectual, half love poem to Thomas Aquinas. I did a lot of skimming if I saw the word \"God\" on the page more than three times. There's lots of good, actionable advice in here (as well as lots of bad, vague advice -- thankfully it seems easy enough to separate the wheat from the chaff)."}
