Book {title = "The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility", author = Just "Gregory Clark", rating = Just "3", review = Just "Had some fascinating insights into social mobility (there's not a lot of it, and that is maybe a good thing), but the best part of the book to me was that it was a case study in good experiment design.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it, but if you are going to anyway, you can skim it -- the conclusions keep being the same."}
