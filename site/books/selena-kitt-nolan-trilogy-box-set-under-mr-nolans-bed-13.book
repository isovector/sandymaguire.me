Book {title = "Nolan Trilogy: Box Set (Under Mr. Nolan's Bed, #1-3)", author = Just "Selena Kitt", rating = Just "3", review = Just "What a weird collection of books. The first one is a fun, sexy, soap opera of a romp. The second one turns into weird Nancy Drew-style detective work, replete with widespread ritualistic rape of teenagers and lots of pregnancy drama. And the third book is some woke political stuff and a law procedural drama. During the course of the series, the titular Mr Nolan goes from being a father to a lover to a father to not a father to a husband to a spy. And that's just one of the tamer arcs."}
