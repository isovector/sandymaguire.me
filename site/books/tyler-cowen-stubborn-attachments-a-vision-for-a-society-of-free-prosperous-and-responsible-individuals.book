Book {title = "Stubborn Attachments: A Vision for a Society of Free, Prosperous, and Responsible Individuals", author = Just "Tyler Cowen", rating = Just "2", review = Just "I just read this a few days ago and can't even remember enough of it to write a real review. Not a good sign. The entire book is an argument that a strong economy is the only thing that matters, and it presents it pretty OK. I wasn't convinced, but did move slightly towards his point of view. I originally rated this 3/5 when I finished it, but in retrospect am giving it a 2/5 because if it were so good I probably would have remembered it."}
