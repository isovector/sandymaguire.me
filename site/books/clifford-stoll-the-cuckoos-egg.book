Book {title = "The Cuckoo's Egg", author = Just "Clifford Stoll", rating = Just "3", review = Just "It's a fun little foray into tracking spies. The Cuckoo's Egg is enough to satisfy your inner Tom Clancy, without delving into dumb action schlock. It's not a book that's going to stick with you, but it's an enjoyable read."}
