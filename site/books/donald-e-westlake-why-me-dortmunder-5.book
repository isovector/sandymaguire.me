Book {title = "Why Me? (Dortmunder, #5)", author = Just "Donald E. Westlake", rating = Just "4", review = Just "I was getting a bit bored by Dortmunder from the last few books; they're a too samey, with one-dimensional characters (the bartender who refers to people by what they drink; the driver whose only discussion topic is what route he took to the meeting --- even though most of the stings don't require a driver!; etc). This book is a nice shake up to the formula, in which Dortmunder accidentally steals the macguffin and can't wait (or manage) to get rid of it."}
