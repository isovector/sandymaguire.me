Book {title = "Write. Publish. Repeat. (The No-Luck-Required Guide to Self-Publishing Success)", author = Just "Sean Platt", rating = Just "2", review = Just "Despite it's dismissal of using tactics over strategy, this book is essentially a book of tactics and mindsets. There is very little actionable advice (although the advice that is there IS good), especially for people who haven't actually written 5 books yet. <br /><br />The end of the book makes a nod to talking about the actual mechanics behind which the authors were able to publish 1.5 million words in a year, and then falls completely short saying \"oh actually we don't want this book to be any longer\". That's why I bought the book, you bastards."}
