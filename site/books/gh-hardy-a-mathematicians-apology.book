Book {title = "A Mathematician's Apology", author = Just "G.H. Hardy", rating = Just "3", review = Just "I read this on a pirate ship. It was pretty alright; I liked a lot of Hardy's descriptions of what it feels like to be a mathematician. In terms of content, there's not much here for a non-mathematician. A light read that I enjoyed but didn't feel as though it improved my life in any way. <br /><br />Somewhat recommended if you're already interested, skip it if you're not."}
