Book {title = "Linguistics: A Very Short Introduction", author = Just "P.H. Matthews", rating = Just "4", review = Just "After a few false starts due to popular science approaches to linguistics, this was exactly that book i was looking for. it's maybe a two hour read, but covers everything from linguistic genealogy to parsing to the shapes your throat needs to warp into to make any of the sound we subconsciously make thousands of times a day. Highly recommended."}
