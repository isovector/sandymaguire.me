Book {title = "Vinyl Cafe Unplugged", author = Just "Stuart McLean", rating = Just "4", review = Just "Chicken soup for the soul. This book is less good than the other Vinyl Cafe books I've read, mostly because these are his more famous stories. If you've heard any on the radio, they're likely to be these."}
