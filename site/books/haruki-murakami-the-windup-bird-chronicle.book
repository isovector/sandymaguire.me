Book {title = "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle", author = Just "Haruki Murakami", rating = Just "3", review = Just "It was fine I guess. The ending was unsatisfying, and the book is exceptionally long, which is not a great combination. The world building is interesting and there are a lot of intriguing questions, but ultimately, like Lost, the book doesn't deliver on them."}
