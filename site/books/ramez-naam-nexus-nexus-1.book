Book {title = "Nexus (Nexus, #1)", author = Just "Ramez Naam", rating = Just "3", review = Just "The first third of this book is spectacular; it promises to weave together interesting technology, psychedelia, theory of mind, and the life of a grad student into one coherent package. And then it turns into Tom Clancy shlock and never comes back to any of those themes. It's a shame how much wasted opportunity I found in this book."}
