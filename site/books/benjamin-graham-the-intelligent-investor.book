Book {title = "The Intelligent Investor", author = Just "Benjamin Graham", rating = Just "3", review = Just "Just read the commentaries after each chapter -- they're much better at describing the concepts than the actual chapters are. As a young, upwardly mobile software developer with more money than I know what to do with, but little love for investing, I found nothing relevant to my interests after chapter 10."}
