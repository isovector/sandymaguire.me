Book {title = "Inside the Illusion (Everworld, #9)", author = Just "Katherine Applegate", rating = Just "3", review = Just "Senna is an interesting experience in character writing. On one hand she's super fascinating, playing Xanatos Speed-Chessmaster, and it's neat to see a protagonist with some fucking agency in this series. On the other hand, her motivations are weak. \"I WANT TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD AND KILL EVERYONE IN MY PATH BECAUSE MY MOM NEVER LOVED ME.\" This is hard to identify with, but maybe that's just 'cause my mom loved me.<br /><br />I was close to giving the book 4 stars because the end is fun, but realized I was bored as fuck for most of it so nah."}
