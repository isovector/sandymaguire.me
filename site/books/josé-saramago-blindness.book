Book {title = "Blindness", author = Just "Jos\233 Saramago", rating = Just "1", review = Just "Fuck everything about this book. It's full of plot holes and a bunch of people who spend their entire time acting stupidly instead of fixing their damn problems -- just so the author can wallow in misery porn. Avoid this book unless you're looking for something that'll make you want to shove scissors into your eyes."}
