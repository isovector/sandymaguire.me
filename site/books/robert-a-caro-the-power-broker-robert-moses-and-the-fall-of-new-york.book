Book {title = "The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York", author = Just "Robert A. Caro", rating = Just "2", review = Just "I gave up on this book after 10%, which given that it's a massive fucking book, is actually quite the trial run. While it's a good read, it's not great, and its extreme length makes that a particularly bad tradeoff. This thing could do with an editor; I'll tolerate reading through the obligatory story of Moses' childhood, but hearing in great detail about his friends' childhoods too is just too much. Maybe it gets better, but maybe it doesn't, and I wasn't invested enough to find out."}
