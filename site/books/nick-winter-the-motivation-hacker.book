Book {title = "The Motivation Hacker", author = Just "Nick Winter", rating = Just "3", review = Just "Inspirational and well written, but I continually found myself wishing for more actionable advice about how to actually go about learning the cool things Nick did (knife throwing, anyone?). The book ends with his results, but I wish they had been fewer and more in-depth case studies about what he found worked and didn't work."}
