Book {title = "Men of Mathematics", author = Just "Eric Temple Bell", rating = Just "1", review = Just "Don't let the introduction of this book fool you! While the front-matter is enticing and exciting, the rest of the book fails to live up to these expectations. This book manages to make an exciting topic boring and hard to suffer through via a combination of flowery, say-nothing prose and a focus on the people rather than the math.<br /><br />OK, I get it -- for the most part, readers do want people stories over math, but those are not the people who are going to be reading this book. Know your audience, Eric Temple Bell. I would not recommend this book in the slightest.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that presents the history of nerdy shit well, treat yourself to \"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\" and skip over this drivel."}
