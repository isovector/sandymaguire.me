Book {title = "Daily Rituals: How Artists Work", author = Just "Mason Currey", rating = Just "4", review = Just "I only made it about 10% through the book before realizing this was not the book I wanted to be reading. It's a collection of habits about individual people with no analysis behind why they do what they do. That being said, this is probably for the best, since I wouldn't trust the author to make such an analysis."}
