Book {title = "The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It", author = Just "Kelly McGonigal", rating = Just "1", review = Just "Don't waste your time. This book is overly reliant on anecdotes and poor examples. For a better, more concise and more scientific approach to the same topic, look at Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow, along with lots of other interesting and useful facts about the brain."}
