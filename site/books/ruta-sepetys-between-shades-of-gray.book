Book {title = "Between Shades of Gray", author = Just "Ruta Sepetys", rating = Just "5", review = Just "Goddamn, the Soviets were bastards. Coming in with a Canadian education that didn't talk much about WW2 whatsoever, this book was an eye-opener. I've been to the KGB museum in Vilnius, which despite being very analytical and textbook about the situation, still managed to ruin my day. Between Shades of Gray is more of a social look at the same people, following them as they're deported from their homes in Lithuania, and eventually are moved to Siberia. It's a heart-wrenching tale, but is somehow wrapped in themes of hope, the preservation of the human spirit, and an unwavering amount of co\246peration with those around you.<br /><br />5/5, strongly recommended."}
