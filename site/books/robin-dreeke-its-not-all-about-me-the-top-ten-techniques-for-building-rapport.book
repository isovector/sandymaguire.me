Book {title = "It's Not All About \"Me\": The Top Ten Techniques for Building Rapport", author = Just "Robin Dreeke", rating = Just "2", review = Just "For a book called \"it's not all about me,\" the author sure likes to talk about himself a lot. Some of the advice is worth keeping in mind, but this isn't enough to save the book. Unofruntately, the majority of the prose here is bad social science explanations and lots of boring personal anecdotes (\"one time I had road rage but decided not to get mad!\"). Save your money and your time by finding a listicle on Buzzfeed or something about this stuff -- it'll probably be higher quality than this drivel."}
