Book {title = "The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: The Story of  Paul Erd\337s and the Search for Mathematical Truth", author = Just "Paul Hoffman", rating = Just "4", review = Just "I'm planning a trip around the world in Erdos' style --- showing up, working hard on a project with someone, and then peaceing out. Most books about mathematicians I hate because they spend too much time discussing their personal lives, and not enough talking about their mathematical contributions. Unfortunately, this is the one book contrary to that style. It's a book with a few fun Erdos anecdotes, but mostly a description of somewhat-related mathematics and mathematicians for the layperson. Cantor's diagonalization argument is great and all, but I know it, and it doesn't help answer any questions I have about Erdos' lifestyle.<br /><br />All of that being said, this is a fun book that's worth reading. It just didn't answer what I was hoping it would."}
