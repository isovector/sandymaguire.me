Book {title = "Computational Philosophy Of Science", author = Just "Paul Thagard", rating = Just "1", review = Just "Instead of being about the computational philosophy of science, this book describes a data definition language and corresponding computer program for problem solving, but, as far as I can tell, neither are useful for anything. /Extremely/ contrived examples are used to showcase the power of the system, but the correlations drawn are completely arbitrary and would be indistinguishable from noise in a real application."}
