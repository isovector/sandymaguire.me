Book {title = "Hackers and Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age", author = Just "Paul Graham", rating = Just "4", review = Just "It's just a bunch of Paul Graham's superb essays collected into one book. Unfortunately the selection of technical posts is showing its age. I'd give the first half of the book five stars and the latter half three, so decided to settle on four. You probably aren't going to have your toes tickled by the second half if you aren't ROBUSTLY INTO LISP."}
