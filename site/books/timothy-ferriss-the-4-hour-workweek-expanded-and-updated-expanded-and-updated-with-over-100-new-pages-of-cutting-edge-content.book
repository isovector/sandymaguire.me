Book {title = "The 4 Hour Workweek, Expanded And Updated: Expanded And Updated, With Over 100 New Pages Of Cutting Edge Content", author = Just "Timothy Ferriss", rating = Just "5", review = Just "While I didn't like a lot of his business advice, which appears to be \"make up a crap product and then seek rent on it for the rest of your life,\" the rest of this book is great. It feels like a spiritual relative of Sebastian Marshall's Ikigai --- reading this book will have you spending a lot of time pondering \"hmm, what kind of life do I really want to live?\" The answer for most people I've talked to is \"not like this,\" but the fear gets in the way.<br /><br />This is a good book about getting over the fear. It's got helpful little exercises for comfort zone expansion, tactics for dealing with bureaucrats, strategies for building prestige, and lots more. And a lot of prompts for trying to figure out what you'd rather be doing, and for figuring out how to get there from here.<br /><br />The gist of all of it is that people don't really want to be millionaires, they want to have what they assume is the millionaire lifestyle. So computer how much money per day you'd actually need in order to live how you'd like, and then work towards that number. Waiting to live until you're too old to appreciate it is a crap strategy."}
