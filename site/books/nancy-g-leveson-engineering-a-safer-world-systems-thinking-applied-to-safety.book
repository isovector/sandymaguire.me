Book {title = "Engineering a Safer World: Systems Thinking Applied to Safety", author = Just "Nancy G. Leveson", rating = Just "3", review = Just "Good thesis, that engineering mistakes are more often systems mistakes. If you defund all of the safety mechanisms, of course things are going to be disastrous when they do go wrong. I've seen this time and time again during my engineering career, where the business people and project managers care only about safety in reactionary circumstances.<br /><br />I abandoned this book about a quarter of the way through though, because my god is it long."}
