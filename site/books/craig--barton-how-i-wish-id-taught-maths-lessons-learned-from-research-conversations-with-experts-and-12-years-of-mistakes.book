Book {title = "How I Wish I'd Taught Maths: Lessons learned from research, conversations with experts, and 12 years of mistakes", author = Just "Craig  Barton", rating = Just "2", review = Just "It's exactly what it says on the tin---a grade-school math teacher rambling about pop-psych. I picked it up hoping that umm, well I'm not entirely sure what I hoped to be honest with you. Maybe that it would give me some good insights into communicating why I like math to people. Maybe it's psych would generalize away from grade-school students to twentysomething autodidacts.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />I mean, really, it's my fault. The title can't get any clearer about what this book is about. If you don't know any psychology from the last 30 years, you'll learn some neat stuff by skimming the capstone sections at the end of each chapter \"three things I'll remember.\" If you do, and you don't care about the intricacies of how 13 year olds approach fractions, you'll probably be fine to give this one a miss."}
