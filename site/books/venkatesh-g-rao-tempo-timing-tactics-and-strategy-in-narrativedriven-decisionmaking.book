Book {title = "Tempo: Timing, Tactics and Strategy in Narrative-Driven Decision-Making", author = Just "Venkatesh G. Rao", rating = Just "1", review = Just "I bought this book on the strength of one article I read and really liked on ribbonfarm.<br /><br />I made a huge mistake, but I *did* learn something from this book -- how not to write one. It's almost a textbook example: front-load with lots and lots of definitions without any motivation. I found myself continually *not* trusting the author, who would make wild claims with no substantiation or citation. <br /><br />All in all, I got about 50% through this book but finally decided to sink the cost. That being said, I'm still going to try to get a refund."}
