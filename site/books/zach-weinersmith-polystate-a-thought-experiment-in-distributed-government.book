Book {title = "Polystate: A Thought Experiment in Distributed Government", author = Just "Zach Weinersmith", rating = Just "3", review = Just "Free-Market Governments: The Book. If you're already deep into economics you won't find much here. If you're not, it's a short read talking about what would happen if we got rid of geospatial-based governments and instead went to a sort-of guild system. Not bad, but not worth writing home about."}
