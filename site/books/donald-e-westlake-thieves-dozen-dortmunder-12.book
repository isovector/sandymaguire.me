Book {title = "Thieves' Dozen (Dortmunder, #12)", author = Just "Donald E. Westlake", rating = Just "3", review = Just "I didn't realize this was a collection of short stories until about three short stories in! Before that I was very confused. But it turns out that short stories are the right length for Dortmunder; he's sorta fun, but quickly loses his welcome --- so lots of short little scenarios are the perfect medium.<br /><br />Some of these are quite good, others are not. All in all it's not an amazing read, but if you're in it this deep, you might as well."}
