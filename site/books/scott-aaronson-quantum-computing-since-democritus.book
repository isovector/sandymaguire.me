Book {title = "Quantum Computing Since Democritus", author = Just "Scott Aaronson", rating = Just "3", review = Just "This book had the interesting property of making me think bigger thoughts without making me think about any big thoughts in particular. There is notably no central theme, and large, seemingly inconsequential mathematical tangents, but it was a useful study in watching the author constantly generalize over concepts.<br /><br />I can't say I enjoyed it, and I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone, but it definitely improved my understanding of computation. There are probably better and faster ways of doing that, but this is what I had to work with."}
