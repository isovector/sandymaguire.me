Book {title = "The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking", author = Just "Edward B. Burger", rating = Just "2", review = Just "If you know what the word \"agency\" means with respect to your life, you're not going to get anything out of this book. Thankfully it's short, but what I wished I had known is that the last three pages are literally an entire recap of the important concepts in the book. Don't read this book, but if you do, just read the synopsis and save yourself an hour of wishy-washy advice for highschool students."}
