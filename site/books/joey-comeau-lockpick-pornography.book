Book {title = "Lockpick Pornography", author = Just "Joey Comeau", rating = Just "1", review = Just "Ugh. Despicable characters who feel like being queer gives them a license to be assholes. If you're into casual theft, break-and-enters, assault, planned rape of underage adolescents, vandalism, drug abuse, and kidnapping, despite none of it being in pursuit of your goals---you might like this book. I didn't."}
