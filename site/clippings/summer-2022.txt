In Japan it’s common for people to say that they speak no English, but then once they realize your Japanese is worse, they’ll open up and speak English. It’s often surprising how good “bad English” is.

Although he’s now dead, his system lives on through a series of audible language lessons called The Pimsleur Method. Each language consists of ninety half hour tapes, divided into three units. You do one a day, every day, for three months. It’s a minimal time commitment, but you leave with the ability to hold some sort of conversation. The level of fluency you’ll achieve is based mostly on the difficulty of the language. Spanish is a lot easier than Russian, and thus you come out of the program with a comparatively good grasp of the language.

Failures of this form can generally be fixed by "just not doing that," which in this case entails forcing yourself to stop eating. I don't like that solution, as it requires an application of willpower, and in general, any solution that requires an application of willpower is a stopgap, not a remedy. I much prefer solutions that get all of myself onto the same page, including the parts that make distracting arguments so they can shovel more food into my mouth while I'm not looking.

Committing to this, and actually doing it once or twice to show myself that I mean business, had an interesting effect. First of all, it had the obvious effects that I stopped stuffing myself and that I occasionally had three-bite snacks available in the fridge.

I occasionally see people hitting the failure mode where they try to apply willpower in order to do a thing (such as only eat half of their sandwich, and save the other half for later) and then fail slightly (such as by taking a bite out of the second half) at which point they proceed to completely ignore the parts of themselves that suggest restraint (such as by eating the entire second half of the sandwich and thereby stuffing themselves).

People might feel strange saving the second half of the sandwich after they've taken two bites out of it, but if you actually do that a few times then it becomes much easier to believe that you can.

Sometimes, the mob in you will make demands that sound unreasonable, such as "cancel everything today, I need a break." In these situations, it's easy to try to force or plea or bargain with yourself. I take a different tactic: I ask myself if this is really what I need, and if it is, then I do it. I show the mob that I respect its demands, and that I'm on its side. After all, we have the same goals; and furthermore, I am not the king in my mind. I do not desire a fight (and if I did, I wouldn't win it).

Often, when a part of me really needs a break, and throws up its hands feeling overwhelmed, its initial demands are unrealistic—"two weeks with no responsibilities!" So then I ask it again, with the demeanor of George Bailey, what it really needs to get by. And that part of me quickly remembers that all of me is in this together, and that I'm trying to do some very difficult things, and that all parts of me are constrained by scarce resources. Then the part that protested searches for what it really needs, the bare minimum, and it usually answers something like "I can get the rest I need in fifteen minutes."

The mental override is a nuclear option.

Experience hypnagogia.Hypnagogia are the "sleep hallucinations" that sometimes happen as you're drifting off to sleep. "Hallucination" isn't really the right word; the experience (for me) is more one of a meandering mind and "threshold conciousness." In my experience, effective naps are almost exclusively preceded by hypnagogia; I postulate that this signals an ability to go directly into a REM state. Fortunately, in my experience, if I'm not experiencing hypnagogia before sleeping, it is possible to induce. There's a mental motion when falling asleep that feels like "hey wait don't fall asleep yet:" not the feeling of fully keeping yourself conscious, but the feeling of trying to stay awake in a boring class. If I maintain that "try to stay awake while falling asleep" state for long enough, I tend to get the hypnagogia.

No seriously, nap without an alarm even when you have important things to do. The way you practice waking up at the end of a dream is you take a nap, without an alarm, about two hours before something important. (Be a little careful here, of course.)

The nice thing about the "what if" question is that I don't need to believe that that's the actual world when pondering the "what if". I don't need to acknowledge that I am unqualified for the job, I can simply ask what would do if I were. This makes it easier to plan out what I would do if I could see the dark world, and having a plan often makes it easier to acknowledge that the world I'm living in is dark.

And after that, everything he does will be aimed at providing an explanation of why he will have lost. He may throw himself at the ball (so he will be able to say he's done his best against a superior opponent). He may dispute calls (so he will be able to say he's been robbed).

They are providing excuses, and these are toxic. They rob you of your power. They rob you of your ability to say "actually, I could have known, if I had been thinking more clearly.

By contrast, I think mastery looks much more like teaching mode — it looks like someone operating in a context where their knowledge and their skills are not the focus, but are just unconscious assumptions in the background.

Many people find it much easier to exercise in a context where the exercise is in the background rather than the foreground. Imagine someone who plays recreational soccer, sprinting up and down the soccer field up till the brink of exhaustion. Now imagine them not playing soccer, but just trying to sprint up and down the field up to the brink of exhaustion. They probably push themselves a lot less in the latter case. If "sprint up and down the field a lot" is the main goal, then at each possible stopping point, part of them starts trying to convince the rest that they've exercised enough for the day, and they must spend willpower to continue. In a soccer match, by contrast, the focus is elsewhere. They aren't constantly pinging themselves with explanations of how they've done enough sprinting for today. They aren't generating reasons why it's OK to stop here. They're trying to score a goal. Getting exercise is a background assumption, not a conscious choice.

Trying to try to run MIRI would feel like just trying to run MIRI — it would feel like thinking about what it takes to run an institute and reading books about running institutes and worrying whether the board of directors thought I was doing a good job and so on. From the inside, I'd probably think I was trying very hard to actually run an institute. Actually trying to run MIRI feels very different from the inside. It doesn't feel like trying to make an institute run, it feels like trying to get all the most important emails handled while not letting administrative duties suck up my day.

Defiance-the-virtue is about encountering a badness that's brewing in the world, and reflexively doing everything you can to throw a wrench in the works, to twist things in your favor. Defiance-the-virtue is about taking nothing lying down, and refusing to let badnesses in the universe slide.

Defiance is not about coming to terms with the world. It's about looking looking at the world and having the same mental reflexes as the defiant child. It's about the reflexive impulse to say "screw this" and choose self-reliance over hopelessness in the face of problems that are crushingly large.

If you have a big decision to make, set aside some time to do some serious thinking. Ask people you trust for the obvious advice, and then actually do it. Set some five-minute timers, spend time describing the problem before you spend time describing possible solutions, brainstorm a wide variety of solutions.

Figure out where you're highly uncertain, find the places where your decision turns on a critical piece of information you're missing, and add actions like "run thus-and-such an experiment" to your set of available actions. Build models. Make your best guesses about the probabilities of various outcomes in response to your actions, make your best guesses about how good those outcomes are, multiply out an expected value calculation, throw the numbers out, and consult your updated intuitions. And so on. Whatever your "think seriously" process is, run it, and then pick the best action available to you (given the information you currently have, having taken into account the incompleteness of your situation). Then do that. Then don't go back into deliberation mode until you encounter information that would have actually changed your answer. If you do it right, there's no need to go back to worrying about which thing you should be doing unless you encounter new evidence or information. When you do, deliberate again — or, better, plug the new evidence into the model you built when you deliberated the first time, instead of re-doing all that work. Half the reason for really deliberating hard the first time is to build a versatile model, anyway. (Though of course, evidence and experience will also cause you to update that model as you go.) Many people seem plagued by "am I doing the right thing?" thoughts which get in the way of them committing themselves to any action. I think there are at least three different types of "am I doing the right thing?" thoughts, each worth treating differently.

On my current best model of where the "am I doing the right thing?" thoughts come from, they tend to come from one of two places. Either (a) some part of you is concerned that your deliberation was dangerously biased, flawed, or otherwise invalid; or (b) some part of you is not yet comfortable in the face of uncertainty.

Binding yourself is not that complicated and doesn’t take long, but the actual moment of precommitting is scarier than it sounds[39]. (After you commit, it’s not scary at all.) Don’t be scared into weakening the resolution. You should bind yourself with something far beyond the scope of the goal you’re trying to accomplish, so that there’s no contest: your motivation should be much higher than needed to get the job done, both so that you don’t fall a little short, and so that you have more fun. If the thought of losing $100 can motivate you to go to the gym three times a week for a month, then bind yourself with $1000 and watch yourself run cheerfully to the gym through the cold rain that you hadn’t planned for.

(I put another $7,290 on finishing the first draft of this book by then.) 2.  I’ve already told Chloe, her friends, all my Human Hacker Housemates, and a bunch of people at a party. I’ll tell my startup cofounders, and I’ll post it on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. (I don’t like using social networks, but I haven’t set up an appropriate public blog yet, and I need to do this right now.) 3.  I’m writing this whole chapter about it in advance, and it would be terribly inconvenient to have to rewrite it with a weaker example, and to fail at something when I’m writing a book about how to do the opposite. (Every little bit helps.) 4.  I already paid for it. 5.  Chloe is counting on me. 6.  I’ll nonchalantly email my twin brother, who went skydiving no problem, and tell him that I’m going to go skydiving as if it’s no problem, too. 7.  I’ll fix the date of the skydive now, so that there’s no chance of scheduling problems.

you might break down front-crawl swimming into dozens of skills, from breathing into the water to having your hand enter the water without splash to rotating your body with each stroke. Then you could come up with a drill for each skill: stand in the pool and breathe in above water and out below water a bunch of times; stand there and push your arm smoothly into the water for five minutes; hold your breath for a few strokes while you focus only on making sure you rotate enough. So while learning the front crawl by trying to do the front crawl should seem too difficult, learning to do it by learning each subskill one-by-one should seem encouragingly easy if you break it down far enough.

When you do pick your goals, forget the advice about SMART goals.[63] Use Piers Steel’s slightly improved CSI Approach. Your goals should be Challenging (if they’re not exciting, they won’t provide Value); Specific (abstract goals can leave you vulnerable to Impulsiveness, since it’s not clear what you need to do); Immediate (avoid long-Delayed goals in favor of ones you can start now and finish soon), and Approach-oriented. (As opposed to avoidance goals, where you try not to do something, you should instead reframe it positively as an attempt to do something—it just feels better.)

The self-experimenter improves by determining what works with simple experiments. For example, I wanted to improve my skin, but I didn’t know what interventions would actually help. I started using facial cleanser on just one half of my face, body wash on just one half of my body, tracking when I showered and changed my sheets, and alternating weeks of wearing a clean T-shirt to bed. I then asked Chloe to help me count my zits each day, without telling her which half was which. I analyzed the data and saw that body wash (p = 0.04) and facial cleanser (p = 0.02) both helped a tiny amount, washing the sheets did nothing, wearing a T-shirt did nothing, missing a day of showering did nothing, and missing multiple days of showering might have hurt a little bit. These results overrule many of my intuitions, and now I can save time not messing around with interventions that don’t work and move on to testing some that might.

one of my first lessons of lucid dreaming: To maintain the lucid dream state, you must modulate your emotions. Too much emotional energy causes the lucid dream to collapse.

the dreamer should concentrate on only three or four objects in the dream, saying, “When they begin to change shape you must move your sight away from them and pick something else, and then look at your hands again. It takes a long time to perfect this technique.”

Our senses provide little distinction between physical reality and the real-seeming illusion of the lucid dream. Only the mind distinguishes between the two realities.

Our suggestions in a state of hypnosis or self-hypnosis act on the senses. For example, we can make a posthypnotic suggestion that certain foods will taste opposite to their normal taste and experience the suggested taste upon waking.

as I lucidly interacted with the dream, some interesting dream figure would become so compelling and real-seeming that my attention to “the dream as dream” decreased significantly. I'd begin to forget that this was “all a dream.” Just as in waking, your conscious attention can begin to drift when lucid dreaming. After a few unfocused moments, you're swept into the dreaming, following its movements, suddenly unaware and no longer lucid. Not only did I need to be consciously aware of being in a dream, I needed to be consciously aware of being aware!

Lucid dreamers must learn to focus simultaneously on both their conscious awareness and the apparent dreaming activities. Lucid dreamers who become overly focused on the dreaming activities get swept back into non-lucid dreaming.

Normally it's because they bring the expectation or mindset of physical space into the psychological space of the lucid dream. When they want to move in a lucid dream, they walk, they flap their arms, they swim through the air, using physical-type effort. They grow frustrated, not realizing that their belief and expectation in the need for physical action is causing their experience.

The dream space largely mirrors your ideas, expectations, and beliefs about it. By changing your expectations and beliefs, you change the dream space. Realizing mental space responds best to mental manipulations, you let go of physical manipulations and use the wings of your mind.

the simplest method to move could be called “concentrated focus with intent.” It's a simple two-part process: 1) As the lucid dreamer, concentrate your focus on the place you want to be; then 2) intend yourself to be at that place, feel it, imagine touching it, engage your mind with it. By concentrating on your goal, you naturally dismiss other concerns and thoughts, sharpening your focus. Intent draws the goal and you together.

Intend to become lucid in the next dream by suggesting, “Next time I'm dreaming, I want to remember to recognize I'm dreaming.” 3. Now imagine that you are back in the recalled dream and becoming lucidly aware at an appropriate point. Visualize this clearly. 4. Keep doing these steps until your intent feels well established.

A student of both the Stoics and Montaigne, the Count’s father believed that our Creator had set aside the morning hours for industry. That is, if a man woke no later than six, engaged in a light repast, and then applied himself without interruption, by the hour of noon he should have accomplished a full day’s labor.

In the afternoon, the Count’s father believed that a man should take care not to live by the watch in his waistcoat—marking the minutes as if the events of one’s life were stations on a railway line. Rather, having been suitably industrious before lunch, he should spend his afternoon in wise liberty. That is, he should walk among the willows, read a timeless text, converse with a friend beneath the pergola, or reflect before the fire—engaging in those endeavors that have no appointed hour, and that dictate their own beginnings and ends.

And the second chime? The Count’s father was of the mind that one should never hear it. If one had lived one’s day well—in the service of industry, liberty, and the Lord—one should be soundly asleep long before twelve. So the second chime of the twice-tolling clock was most definitely a remonstrance.

the answer to this conundrum was provided by the philosopher Zeno in the fifth century B.C. Achilles, a man of action and urgency, trained to measure his exertions to the tenth of a second, should be able to quickly dispense with a twenty-yard dash. But in order to advance a yard, the hero must first advance eighteen inches; and in order to advance eighteen inches, he must first advance nine; but to advance nine, he must first advance four and a half, and so on. Thus, on his way to completing the twenty-yard dash, Achilles must traverse an infinite number of lengths—which, by definition, would take an infinite amount of time. By extension (as the Count had liked to point out), the man who has an appointment at twelve has an infinite number of intervals between now and then in which to pursue the satisfactions of the spirit.

The triumph over progressives was total. Harding had restored the old coalition of 1896, winning sixteen million votes to the Democratic nominee’s nine million, 60.3 percent to 34.1 percent. The GOP even penetrated the Confederate South, taking Tennessee, and safe Democratic states such as Arizona and Oklahoma. Not a single Democrat won a Senate or governor seat anywhere outside the South.

President Warren G. Harding formally appointed Mellon under the pretense that a plutocrat like Mellon was so rich he couldn’t be bought.30 The real reason was that a Mellon Bank had lent $1.5 million to Harding’s campaign in 1920. Mellon had become bored with being a mere tycoon. As one of his enemies put it, “Mellon needed a change, and the Grand Old Party needed the cash.”

Mellon’s appointment was probably illegal. A statute from 1789 prohibits the treasury secretary from engaging in commerce or trade, an absurd expectation for a man with such industrial power.32 The founders had also written a law blocking the treasury secretary from holding bank stocks, another absurdity. Mellon overcame these legal restrictions by pretending to sell his assets to his brother.

Mellon was also the “financial angel” of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, so powerful that when his ill-considered marriage fell apart in a scandalous split, he had the state legislature pass a law giving judges the right to deny women a trial by jury in divorce cases.44 Local newspapers, afraid or in thrall to the Mellon family, reported little on the matter.

At first little known, the Republican-dominated press gradually gave Mellon more and more credit for the boom times, especially after the horrific economic experience of 1919–1920. Millions of Americans soon revered him. He was commonly known as the best secretary of the treasury “since Alexander Hamilton.”58 Indeed, it was Mellon who placed Hamilton, America’s original proponent of monopoly, on the $10 bill.

The problem increasingly became one of deflation, or a collapse in prices and wages. When a bank went bust, that bank would stop lending and deposits would be frozen. This meant credit would contract, and money would be taken out of circulation. People and businesses would in turn have less purchasing power to buy goods and services, and to service their debts. So they would buy less, hire fewer people, pay less in taxes as well as default on loans. Prices and wages would go down. Farmers, having borrowed on the assumption that the corn or cotton they grew would sell at a certain price, would find their crops selling at half or a quarter of what they thought they’d be able to get. As farm mortgage defaults spiked, more banks would in turn go bankrupt. Politicians, in thrall to the notion the government had to balance the budget, would often raise taxes as tax revenue fell, making the problem worse.

Roosevelt told advisor Rexford Tugwell that “there was latent… not far below the surface of our disrupted society, an impulse among a good many ‘strong’ men, men used to having their way, mostly industrialists who directed affairs without being questioned, a feeling that democracy had run its course and that the totalitarians had grasped the necessities of the time. People wanted strong leadership; they were sick of uncertainty, anxious for security, and willing to trade liberty for it.”

Edgar Brown of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, testified to the Senate that he lost his fortune of $225,000 through National City’s scams. He had run a chain of theaters, but after contracting tuberculosis, he sold his business interests and left to California while entrusting the money to National City. He asked that they put his money into bonds and safe investments. Nevertheless, his City broker instead used Brown’s savings to buy Peruvian bonds, Anaconda copper, and even the stock of National City itself. National City had interests in all of these. Brown ended up in poverty.

Pecora also uncovered the extensive system of bribery by which the Morgan firm paid off political, military, and financial elites through the stock market, a system known as the “preferred list.” The preferred list was a list of people from whom the company sought to keep in their graces, and to whom it would offer below-cost stock that could be resold immediately at a profit.

The cost of pots, pans, airplanes, radios, trains, bullets, and refrigerators went up. Senators joked, when the U.S. went off the gold standard, that the country should adopt the aluminum standard.

When the Roosevelt administration entered office in 1933, three quarters of the federal judiciary were conservative Republicans; the average lower court judge was sixty years old and had gone to law school in the McKinley administration.69 In the summer of 1935, “more than 100 district court judges held Acts of Congress unconstitutional; federal courts issued more than 1,600 injunctions blocking enforcement of New Deal laws.”

Eccles had warned speculation was being caused by “monopolistic practices” leading to price hikes. He was telling Roosevelt that steelmakers were raising prices far more quickly than they were raising wages, and this led to unused resources in terms of both unemployment and inflation. When the speculative bubble about which he warned popped and the economy slid rapidly, he fell in with antimonopolists. Pointing to the steel industry, he said that “those industries that have maintained prices and curtailed output should seek the restoration of profits through increased rather than restricted output.”

Increasingly, the corporation was able to exploit a “buying monopoly” (or in economic literature “monopsony”). Because A&P controlled so much of America’s food market, it was able to demand that food suppliers give the company better prices, which it could then use to further undercut rivals. It also forced suppliers to pay kickbacks to stock their products. These bribes took the form of “advertising allowances,” or payments by manufacturers for A&P to advertise its products.

Ben Shahn rather wryly commented, “It may be a point of great pride to have a Van Gogh on the living room wall, but the prospect of having Van Gogh himself in the living room would put a great many devoted art lovers to rout.”

Such respites also, perhaps, allow the finished work time to find its rightful place in the artist’s heart and mind — in short, a chance to be understood better by the maker. Then when the time comes for others to judge the work, their reaction (whatever it may be) is less threatening.

Conversely, catering to fears of being misunderstood leaves you dependent upon your audience. In the simplest yet most deadly scenario, ideas are diluted to what you imagine your audience can imagine, leading to work that is condescending, arrogant, or both. Worse yet, you discard your own highest vision in the process.

On both intellectual and technical grounds, it’s wise to remain on good terms with your artistic heritage, lest you devote several incarnations to re-inventing the wheel. But once having allowed for that, the far greater danger is not that the artist will fail to learn anything from the past, but will fail to teach anything new to the future.

the audience is seldom in a position to grant (or withhold) approval on the one issue that really counts — namely, whether or not you’re making progress in your work. They’re in a good position to comment on how they’re moved (or challenged or entertained) by the finished product, but have little knowledge or interest in your process. Audience comes later. The only pure communication is between you and your work.

Most artists keep a well-rehearsed speech close at hand for fielding the familiar request to explain a finished piece. But if asked to describe how it felt during the artmaking — well, that often comes out a bit like Dorothy trying to describe the Land of Oz to Auntie Em. Between the initial idea and the finished piece lies a gulf we can see across, but never fully chart.

when you watch your work unfold day by day, piece by piece, there’s no escaping cause and effect. Simply put, what you did got you here, and if you apply the same methods again you will likely get the same result again. This is true not just for being stuck, but for all other artistic states as well - including highly productive states. As a practical matter, ideas and methods that work usually continue to work. If you were working smoothly and now you are stuck, chances are you unnecessarily altered some approach that was already working perfectly well.

The dilemma every artist confronts, again and again, is when to stick with familiar tools and materials, and when to reach out and embrace those that offer new possibilities. And on average, the younger artist tends to experiment with a large and varied range of tools and materials, while the veteran artist tends to employ a small and specific set.

He is intrigued by the way she writes to him, and is surprised to find that in the graphic lexicon of sex, she can certainly hold her own. All this sexualizes her in his eyes. Freed from the predictability of a script, he takes a second look. The pseudo anonymity of their E-mails has allowed him to see her as a subject with her own desires, turning her into the object of his desire. “I’m saying things to her that I never thought I could. I expected she’d be turned off, but she’s not. She needs a lot less taking care of than I projected onto her,” Philip admits. “I realized I put a lot of stuff on her that doesn’t belong to her.

Historians had traditionally seen mass movements of the Midwest and South, such as the farmers’ revolts of the nineteenth century, as populist; Hofstadter recast them as oppressive cultural reactions to modernization. He contrasted Anglo-Saxonism with polyglot, tolerant, and forward-looking immigrant cultures of eastern cities.

This narrative, however, created a problem. It was impossible to ignore the many mass movements and American figures who stood outside such a consensus, such as the populists of the nineteenth century or independent retailers opposed to A&P’s power. Hofstadter solved this problem by recasting such factions not as ideological rivals to concentrated capital, but as groups of nostalgia-driven Anglo-Saxon white men irrationally adhering to an “American mythology,” seeking to return to a time when their racial group was the most important part of the social order and struggling with modernity and cosmopolitanism.

The populists of the 1890s were not so much against monopolies, he implied in his next book, The Age of Reform, as they were nascent fascists.

Several contemporary historians considered Hofstadter’s writing “highly manipulative,” and his work was not based in actual historical primary source evidence.55 Nevertheless, with his succinct writing style, his placement within powerful Democratic networks, and keen sense of what kinds of ideas could sell, his work would prove to become essential to dampening the American intellectual suspicion toward concentrated financial power.

Democrats had found a way to structure commerce around the concept of industrial liberty. Whether farmers, manufacturers, shopkeepers, or workers, this kind of competition policy centered on engineering maximum liberty for the producer as opposed to the financier or monopolist. In 1958, a new concept replaced industrial liberty: affluence

Galbraith’s argument was simple: America was rich. Modern institutions, meaning big government, big business, and big labor, had evolved to produce more and more over time, using the fabulous technology that came from the corporate research labs and new universities. Yet, politics was still rooted in questions of scarcity, poverty, and class conflict. “These—productivity, inequality and insecurity—were the ancient preoccupations of economics,” he wrote. No longer.

Galbraith’s job was to fight inflation, a difficult task in a wartime economy straining to produce consumer and military goods at maximum volume. The OPA under Galbraith put in place a structure for restraining price increases of farm products and canned foods, but one that was especially confusing to farmers and small stores. This experience reinforced his belief in command-and-control statism and the virtues of concentration. It was far easier to work with chain stores such as A&P to fix prices.

Galbraith benefited from the new direction of economics. The newly professionalizing field of economists stopped writing for a mass audience. Galbraith seized the opportunity to write for the public. While economists increasingly hid their political ideas inside of formulas under the pretense that they were physicists and thus doing science impenetrable to the layman, Galbraith wrote best-sellers in plain English with clear and playfully sardonic passages about power.

Hofstadter and Galbraith together created a new language and new frame of analysis designed to eliminate the antimonopoly tradition in American politics. A new villain, the grubby racist small businessman, had replaced the money trust. The antimonopolists, far from noble, were just motivated by status anxiety. Countervailing power, operating automatically, addressed any ills from concentrated corporations, which brought modernity, wealth, and technological progress. The real political questions for liberals centered on how to promote art and beauty, end racial bigotry, stop environmental pollution, and promote peace. Corporate power nowhere on the list.

Men trained in Brandeis’s thinking still ran policy in government agencies, the courts, and law schools, and would remain in control for the next generation. In no small part, this was driven by the older generation’s still-potent fear of domestic fascism. As late as 1961, Kennedy’s Antitrust head reminded the public that the “cartels of Western Europe led directly to the corporate fascist states of Mussolini and Hitler, that represented extremes in concentration of power.”91 Populists with long memories remained in powerful positions in Congress.

I did learn Spanish before I went to South America. I had expected to travel somewhere in South American but I hadn’t decided where and was learning Spanish in preparation. But then I received an invitation to visit Brazil to do research there for three months.The invitation came six weeks before I was to go and I spent the six weeks “converting” my newly learned Spanish to Portuguese. People like to make up stories about how I have been foolish on occasion. So I let this story stand, as if I didn’t know they speak Portuguese in Brazil. I hope they will be satisfied with that story and not probe deeper to find out how much more of a fool I have been on other occasions and start stories about those.

when he first came here he gave a series of seminars on how the heavier elements might be formed in stars if it all started as hydrogen (as his steady state theory proposed). It was all very carefully analyzed and impressive in its attention to detail. He concluded that it wouldn’t work unless there was a nuclear level in carbon close to 7.62 MeV. Since he believed his hydrogen theory he said there must be such a level. We were all very impressed.To find the position of a nuclear level (as yet unknown) by looking not at nuclei in the laboratory, but at the stars in the sky seemed to us most remarkable and courageous. He was right, the level was soon found.

He has made himself fully aware of all the problems in fundamental theoretical physics, from gravitation, cosmology and the new unified field theories, to the detailed problems of hadron physics and the weak interactions. The method he uses in studying each question is not so much to read about it, but to work it all out himself. He works very hard.

This shows a complete misunderstanding of the nature of my book.There is nothing at all in it that would be “important” to a German reader, or to any other reader for that matter. It is not in any way a scientific book, nor a serious one. It is not even an autobiography.

The original builders, who were of course ancients and therefore wise, knew this very well and the whole point of a correctly-built pyramid was to achieve absolute null time in the central chamber so that a dying king, tucked up there, would indeed live forever—or at least, never actually die. The time that should have passed in the chamber was stored in the bulk of the pyramid and allowed to flare off once every twenty-four hours.

It is now known to science that there are many more dimensions than the classical four. Scientists say that these don’t normally impinge on the world because the extra dimensions are very small and curve in on themselves, and that since reality is fractal most of it is tucked inside itself. This means either that the universe is more full of wonders than we can hope to understand or, more probably, that scientists make things up as they go along.

To someone unaware of the meaning behind the rhetoric, this new Director-altered language made it sound like Chicago Schoolers opposed monopolies and collusive arrangements, and that it fit squarely within a conservative tradition. But Director was creating an elaborate rhetorical trap. Monopolies and collusive arrangements had been understood as emerging from the corporate sphere. Chicago Schoolers, led by Director, used monopolies to refer to things like public schools and labor unions. Director was, as Hofstadter had on the left, making corporate monopolists the protectors of liberty.

Bork was receiving funding from AEI to rewrite the history of antitrust. He chose to do a historical study, in theory to determine what Congress meant when it passed various antitrust statutes, starting with the Sherman Act in 1890. The correct rational way to do antitrust, he said, would “grow naturally out of this study.”89 Over the course of the next year, AEI kept offering Bork money, as much as he needed to finish the study. The result was the germ of the book that, beginning a decade later, would entirely change how Washington elites understood—and enforced—America’s antimonopoly laws.

Nixon banished a reactor that was virtually meltdown-proof, left comparatively little long-lived waste, made it more difficult to fashion a bomb from the waste, ran at friendlier atmospheric pressure instead of the potentially explosive pressurized environments of conventional reactors, and ran at much higher temperatures, making it more cost-effective as an electricity generator.

one of the main reasons thorium reactors weren’t developed in the Sixties. The U.S. government wanted a source of weaponizable uranium and plutonium. They went in with the mindset that we would control all the reactors and that the fuel cycle that gave us the bomb-grade stuff was a good idea. But that means that there has been a built-in block against making nuclear power generally available.

In the molten salt reactor, the design works the opposite way: cooling, enough to keep a plug of salt frozen, is powered by the reactor itself. If the reactor or generator fails, the plug melts, and the fuel flows into a sump where it’s too spread out to maintain a reaction.

The first method is far more difficult. It demands the same skill, devotion, insight, and even inspiration as the discovery of the simple physical laws which underlie the complex phenomena of nature. It also requires a willingness to accept objectives which are limited by physical, logical, and technological constraints, and to accept a compromise when conflicting objectives cannot be met. No committee will ever do this until it is too late.

People are generally terrible at unraveling complex chains of causality through the economy, and will typically blame whomever is most closely associated in the public mind with any problem. They blame aeronautical engineers, not regulators, for the lack of flying cars. They blame oil companies, not price controls and drilling bans, for an energy crisis. And at least to some extent they blamed technology, not the fact that it was being suppressed, for the economic malaise of the Seventies. That in turn called for more regulation, which suppressed more technology, in a runaway feedback loop.

There is certainly a feedback to the horror story industry, but as we have seen it has nothing to do with whether the stories are proved right or wrong in reality. Pundits and organizations profited greatly, both in money but perhaps more importantly in prestige; and this is the feedback that counted. But the scare industry is completely unregulated, and its profits come at the cost of a great social externality: the pollution of knowledge with dire falsehoods.

even in the best human-designed bureaucracies, the primary function of the system will ultimately become insulating decision makers from accountability and feedback. The simple and obvious reason is that people don’t like to be held accountable, and if allowed to design the systems they work in as they like, will put in plenty of insulation. And once that happens, cynicism sets in and the “same boat” spirit evaporates.

In the classic case of the energy crisis, for example, when energy in the form of oil becomes scarce, the price rises. This is a signal and incentive for several things: oil users economize and cut back on less valuable uses. People try to move oil from places where it is plentiful (and cheap) to places where it is scarce (and dear). Others begin to spend more resources and effort on finding new supplies or inventing substitutes. These are all exactly the things any sensible governor would do in the case of a shortage. But instead, cynical pols (notably Nixon) said, “Oh, horrible, the price of oil is too high,” and instituted price controls, anesthetizing the pain of overuse, choking the incentive to create new supplies, and causing an energy crisis where none existed before.

Full atomic control means that we do not have to thermalize chemical potential energy to use it. This in turn means that you don’t have to strain the bounds of material science to accomodate ultra-hot temperatures in your engine. It also means you get three or four times the usable energy from a given quantity of fuel, instead of sacrificing it on the altar of thermodynamics.

“Don’t look so glum! You’ll be upholding the honor of Ankh-Morpork, remember!” “Really, dear? What shall I do with the other hand?” said Vimes, settling back into the seat. “Oh, Sam! Tonight you’ll walk with kings!” I’d sooner be walking all by myself along Treacle Mine Road at three in the morning, Vimes thought. In the rain, with the gutters gushing. But it was a wife thing. She took such a . . . a pride in him. He could never work out why.

On the off chance that this approach doesn’t work, you should start to seriously consider writing a letter. But first seek out as many senior people in the chain of command who will listen to you. Make sure you record the name of everyone with whom you speak—the helpful as well as the worthless ones. It’s important to note that occasionally your appeal will be granted simply because the person in charge wishes to get rid of you.

Grab the reader’s attention at the beginning of the letter. After the salutation, an immediate attention getter is a must. It may only be one sentence, but it must catch the recipient’s eye. My favorites are “I am shocked and appalled at the unprofessional treatment to which I have been subjected by [company name] personnel” or “I am sure that you will be as shocked and appalled as I am over the recent incident I have experienced with company X.” This method will pique the curiosity of your reader, and it is a not-so-subtle encouragement to continue reading the rest of the letter.

Close firmly and politely. The last paragraph is where you should not only thank the reader but also let him or her know that you expect a quick answer. You can specify the need for a response “immediately,” or give a fixed period of time; for instance, “I expect to hear from you within two weeks [or one month] regarding this situation.” Although it has been my experience that most people rarely get a response quite as quickly as “within two weeks,” making such a request does place the brass on alert that you are not twiddling your thumbs and waiting around for the mail carrier.

Avoid name-calling by pairing nouns with adjectives, such as “the rude salesclerk.” Refer to the “clerk” and then state that in your opinion the treatment you received was “rude.” Depersonalize the offending parties as much as possible, and concentrate on the effect their conduct had.

He had grown lazy and soft; the young man who dressed in silk and could distinguish Nada sake from the local brew by its taste was a far cry from the simple, rugged Matahachi who had been at Sekigahara.

it was one phase of a huge building program, an important part of the Tokugawa scheme of government. Construction work on a large scale was also being carried out in Edo, Nagoya, Suruga, Hikone, Ōtsu and a dozen other castle towns. The purpose was to a large extent political, for one of Ieyasu’s methods of maintaining control over the daimyō was to order them to undertake various engineering projects. Since none was powerful enough to refuse, this kept the friendly lords too busy to grow soft, while simultaneously forcing the daimyō who’d opposed Ieyasu at Sekigahara to part with large portions of their incomes. Still another aim of the government was to win the support of the common people, who profited both directly and indirectly from extensive public works.

In response to their questions, Matahachi made up a story in which his sterling qualities figured prominently and his weaknesses not at all. Taking advantage of the fact that he was talking to Yoshioka partisans, he brought up Musashi’s name. They had been childhood friends, he revealed, until Musashi had abducted his fiancée and covered his family with unspeakable shame. His valiant mother had vowed not to return home; both his mother and himself were bent on finding Musashi and destroying him. As for being Okō’s husband, this was far from the truth. His long stay at the Yomogi Teahouse was not because of any personal connection with the proprietress, and the proof of this was in her having fallen in love with Gion Tōji.

By all accepted standards, Musashi was not a great sword technician. Schools, styles, theories, traditions—none of these meant anything to him. His mode of fighting was completely pragmatic.

He had come to see the Way of the Sword in a new light. A year or two earlier, he had wanted only to conquer all rivals, but now the idea that the sword existed for the purpose of giving him power over other people was unsatisfying. To cut people down, to triumph over them, to display the limits of one’s strength, seemed increasingly vain. He wanted to conquer himself, to make life itself submit to him, to cause people to live rather than die. The Way of the Sword should not be used merely for his own perfection. It should be a source of strength for governing people and leading them to peace and happiness.

Among the possibilities he had considered was choosing the easy way. If he could bring himself to live in a comfortable, ordinary way with Otsū, life would be simple. Almost any fief would be willing to pay him enough to live on, perhaps five hundred to a thousand bushels. But when he put it to himself in the form of a question, the answer was always no. An easy existence imposed restrictions; he could not submit to them.

Musashi glared viciously at the departing pair, his lips set tightly in an angry scowl. “Not one thing.” Reflecting on Gudō’s words, he decided they were deceitful, suggesting the man had something to offer when in fact there was “not one thing” in his foolish head. “Wait and see,” thought Musashi. “I don’t need you!” He would rely on no one. In the final analysis, there was no one to rely on but himself. He was a man, just as Gudō was a man and all the earlier masters had been men.

What has calloused your mind? You’ll need to have those answers at your fingertips when you hit a wall of pain and doubt.

Set ambitious goals before each workout and let those past victories carry you to new personal bests. If it’s a run or bike ride, include some time to do interval work and challenge yourself to beat your best mile split. Or simply maintain a maximum heart rate for a full minute, then two minutes. If you’re at home, focus on pull-ups or push-ups. Do as many as possible in two minutes. Then try to beat your best. When the pain hits and tries to stop you short of your goal, dunk your fist in, pull out a cookie, and let it fuel you!

We settle as individuals, and we teach our children to settle for less than their best, and all of that ripples out, merges, and multiplies within our communities and society as a whole.

The invention starts out at the source as an idea born in the mind of a remarkable innovator whom we may be entitled to regard as a genius. Gradually, like tributaries joining the main flow of the stream, other inventors and thinkers become involved. Finally, as the river approaches the ocean, it widens into a delta. There, hundreds or even thousands of expert technicians toil away in well-organized, well-funded, yet comparatively anonymous groups such as the research and development teams of major international corporations. The river’s flow into the ocean represents the idea’s comprehensive acceptance by the mainstream of human culture and society.

While capacitors are everywhere to provide local storage of energy for all the components, the resistors remove excess energy. Fast signals on a motherboard carry a lot of energy, and if the energy is not dissipated at the receiver in a controlled fashion with a resistor, the signal energy will reflect back to the transmitter and cause problems.

CTT is a current-mode signaling convention that drives +8 mA or -8 mA into a 50 ohm transmission line terminated at 1.5 volts. The receiver is a differential amplifier that compares the reference termination voltage with the transmission line voltage. In the Virtex-E, a CTT receiver amplifier is specified to work as long as the received voltage swings more than 200 mV up or down from the reference voltage. Most CMOS transmitters driving a CTT terminated line will have no problem sourcing or sinking 8 mA of current into a 50 ohm load.

the pattern of the transportation lines remained what it had been in the past. All the mistakes that had been made in the railroad building period were made again with this new type of locomotive. Main highways cut through the center of towns, despite the congestion, the friction, the noise, and the dangers that attended this old paleotechnic practice. Treating the motor car solely as a mechanical object, its introducers made no attempt to introduce appropriate utilities which would realize its potential benefits.

Cheapness and quantity production, combined with the extravagant re-building of old-fashioned highway systems—^with here and there honorable exceptions, as in New Jersey, Michigan and Westchester County, New York—have only increased the inefficiency of motor cars in use. The losses from congestion, both in the crowded and hopelessly entangled metropolises, and along the roads by means of which people attempt to escape the cities on holidays, are incalculably large in countries which, like the United States and England, have taken over the motor car most heedlessly and complacently.

the breadth and too-frequent repetition of personal intercourse may be socially inefficient is already plain through the abuse of the telephone: a dozen five minute conversations can frequently be reduced in essentials to a dozen notes whose reading, writing, and answering takes less time and effort and nervous energy than the more personal calls. With the telephone the flow of interest and attention, instead of being self-directed, is at the mercy of any strange person who seeks to divert it to his own purposes.

The lifting of restrictions upon close human intercourse has been, in its first stages, as dangerous as the flow of populations into new lands: it has increased the areas of friction. Similarly, it has mobilized and hastened mass-reactions, like those which occur on the eve of a war, and it has increased the dangers of international conflict.

The photograph, to begin with, served as an independent objective check upon observation. The value of a scientific experiment lies partly in the fact that it is repeatable and thus verifiable by independent observers: but in the case of astronomical observations, for example, the slowness and fallibility of the eye can be supplemented by the camera, and the photograph gives the effect of repetition to what was, perhaps, a unique event, never to be observed again.

The witch sitting to the right of Fudge with her face in shadow moved slightly, but everyone else was quite still and silent. “And what is that supposed to mean?” asked Fudge icily. “It means that I think they were ordered there,” said Dumbledore. “I think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through Little Whinging!” barked Fudge. “Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days,” said Dumbledore calmly. “I have already given you my views on this matter, Cornelius.” “Yes, you have,” said Fudge forcefully, “and I have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge, Dumbledore. The dementors remain in place in Azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to.” “Then,” said Dumbledore, quietly but clearly, “we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of August.”

The simplicity of the cardboard mechanism is a great virtue, but it is overshadowed by two drawbacks, a minor one and a major one. The minor one is that the mechanism can, indeed, be used for producing the greatest common divisor of 111 and 259, but for very little else. The major drawback, however, is that, no matter how carefully we inspect the construction of the mechanism, our confidence that it produces the correct answer can only be based on our faith in the manufacturer: he may have made an error, either in the design of his machine or in the production of our particular copy.

The freedom to replace one pebble with a two-dimensional freedom of position by two half-pebbles with a one-dimensional freedom of position is exploited in the suggested two-register machine. From a technical point of view this is very attractive; one only needs to build registers able to distin- guish between 500 different cases ("values") and by just combining two such registers, the total number of different cases is squared! This multi- plicative rule enables us to distinguish between a huge number of possible total states with the aid of a modest number of components with only a modest number of possible states each.

It is then con- ceivable that the computation is carried out by an automaton that, given (the formal description of) the algorithm and the arguments, will produce the answers without further human intervention. Such automata, able to carry out the mutual confrontation of algorithm and argument with each other, have indeed been built. They are called "automatic computers".

For a fixed mechanism S such a rule, which is fed with the predicate R denoting the post-condition and delivers a predicate wp(S, R) denoting the corresponding weakest precondition, is called "a predicate transformer". When we ask for the definition of the semantics of the mechanism S, what we really ask for is its corresponding predicate transformer.

If one so desires one can approach the problem of programming language design from out of that corner. In such an approach the -rather formal- starting point is that the rules for constructing predicate transformers must be such that whatever can be constructed by applying them must be a predic- ate transformer enjoying the properties 1 through 4 from the previous chapter "The Characterization of Semantics", for if they don't, you are just massag- ing predicates in a way such that they can no longer be interpreted as post- conditions and corresponding weakest preconditions respectively.

Any effort to evaluate the value of a variable having that unique, special value "UNDEFINED" can then be honoured by program abortion and an error message. Upon closer scrutiny, however, this simple proposal leads to logical problems; for instance, it is then impossible to copy the values of any set of variables. Efforts to remedy that situation include, for instance, the possibility to inspect whether a value is defined or not. But such ability to manipulate the special value -e.g. the value "NIL" for a pointer pointing nowhere- easily leads to confusions and contradictions: one might discover a case of bigamy when meeting two bachelors married to the same "nobody". Another way out, abolishing the variables with undefined values, has been the implicit initialization upon block entry not with a very special, but with a very common, almost "neutral" value (say "zero" for all integers and "true" for all booleans). But this, of course, is only fooling oneself; now detection of a very common programming error has been made impossible by making all sorts of nonsensical programs artificially into legal ones.

Foreign Affairs, Customs, and the airlines, are all being screwed blind, twenty-four hours a day, by a hundred different hackers – and, ironically, that’s what makes it possible, if you’re lucky, to trace an illegal traveler. Hackers may run rings around the target systems’ own archaic security, but they can’t avoid making their presence known to each other. In the process of capturing data essential for their own work, they can’t help capturing details of other violations in progress. Like all information, this is for sale.

The lack of a positive result rules out nothing; the X-rays in the cargo record could have been fudged, a few minutes after they were taken. Computerized information is as evanescent as the quantum vacuum, with virtual truths and falsehoods endlessly popping in and out of existence. Deceptions of any magnitude are possible, on a short enough time scale; laws only apply to data that sits still long enough to be caught out.

“Chanting the atom deflections may have helped. But I suspect that just wanting the experiment to work, badly enough, was all it took. The more I wanted it, the greater the number of versions of me who’d still want it, once I was smeared – and so the total smeared Po-kwai must have ended up wanting it, too. Anything else would have been highly undemocratic.” She says this tongue-in-cheek, but not entirely.

In fact physiological investigations had revealed that extroversion was linked with resting states of low cortical arousal, introversion with high cortical arousal; this had sounded backward to Michel at first, but then he remembered that the cortex inhibits the lower centers of the brain, so that low cortical arousal allows the more uninhibited behavior of the extrovert, while high cortical arousal is inhibitory and leads to introversion.

John wished (as he had before) that everyone on the planet was Swiss, or at least like the Swiss. Or more like the Swiss in certain ways, anyway. Their love of country seemed to be expressed by making a certain kind of life: rational, just, prosperous, scientific. They would work for that life anywhere, because to them it was the life that mattered, not a flag or a creed or a set of words, nor even that small rocky patch of land they owned on Earth. The Swiss road-building crew back there was Martian already, having brought the life and left the baggage behind.

One look at his grimace and John could read it all, the whole complex of disgust and impatience and amusement. A part of John was pleased at this instant recognition; he knew his old friend better than he had ever known any of his family, so that the swarthy pale-eyed face glowering at him was like that of a brother, a twin that he couldn’t ever remember not knowing. On the other hand, he was annoyed with Frank for his condescension.

Lit up by Maya as usual, he had to admit it. She made him pay attention. Sex for her was not (as it tended to be for John) some kind of extension of sport; it was a grand passion to her, a transcendent state of being, and she was so tigerish when she got going that she always surprised him, woke him up, brought him up to her level, reminded him what sex could be.

“That’s the only real measure of our contribution to the system,” Vlad would say. “If you burn our bodies in a microbomb calorimeter you’ll find we contain about six or seven kilocalories per gram of weight, and of course we take in a lot of calories to sustain that through our lives. Our output is harder to measure, because it’s not a matter of predators feeding on us, as in the classic efficiency equations—it’s more a matter of how many calories we create by our efforts, or send on to future generations, something like that. And most of that is very indirect, naturally, and it involves a lot of speculation and subjective judgment. If you don’t go ahead and assign values to a number of non-physical things, then electricians and plumbers and reactor builders and other infrastructural workers would always rate as the most productive members of society, while artists and the like would be seen as contributing nothing at all.”

“The basic equation is simple, efficiency merely equals the calories you put out, divided by the calories you take in, times one hundred to put it in the form of a percentage. In the classic sense of passing along calories to one’s predator, ten percent was average, and twenty percent doing really well. Most predators at the tops of food chains did more like five percent.” “This is why tigers have ranges of hundreds of square kilometers,” Vlad said. “Robber barons are not really very efficient.”

Bilhah offered Adahni, in memory of my grandmother Adah, who had loved them all. This led to a long session of sighing and remembering Adah, who would have been so delighted by all of her grandchildren. But Zilpah worried that such a name would confuse the demons, who might think Adah had escaped from the underworld and come after me.

In the winter of 1807, thirteen like-minded souls in London got together at the Freemasons Tavern at Long Acre, in Covent Garden, to form a dining club to be called the Geological Society. The idea was to meet once a month to swap geological notions over a glass or two of Madeira and a convivial dinner. The price of the meal was set at a deliberately hefty fifteen shillings to discourage those whose qualifications were merely cerebral.

One of the better early attempts at dating the planet came from the ever-reliable Edmond Halley, who in 1715 suggested that if you divided the total amount of salt in the worlds seas by the amount added each year, you would get the number of years that the oceans had been in existence, which would give you a rough idea of Earths age. The logic was appealing, but unfortunately no one knew how much salt was in the sea or by how much it increased each year,

Clearly there was more to extinctions than could be accounted for by a single Noachian deluge, as the Biblical flood was known. Cuvier resolved the matter to his own satisfaction by suggesting that Genesis applied only to the most recent inundation. God, it appeared, hadnt wished to distract or alarm Moses with news of earlier, irrelevant extinctions.

Rutherford was not an especially brilliant man and was actually pretty terrible at mathematics. Often during lectures he would get so lost in his own equations that he would give up halfway through and tell the students to work it out for themselves. According to his longtime colleague James Chadwick, discoverer of the neutron, he wasnt even particularly clever at experimentation. He was simply tenacious and open-minded.

No matter what I study, I can see patterns. I see the gestalt, the melody within the notes, in everything: mathematics and science, art and music, psychology and sociology. As I read the texts, I can think only that the authors are plodding along from one point to the next, groping for connections that they can't see. They're like a crowd of people unable to read music, peering at the score for a Bach sonata, trying to explain how one note leads to another. As glorious as these patterns are, they also whet my appetite for more. There are other patterns waiting to be discovered, gestalts of another scale entirely. With respect to those, I'm blind myself; all my sonatas are just isolated data points by comparison. I have no idea what form such gestalts might assume, but that'll come in time. I want to find them, and comprehend them. I want this more than anything I've ever wanted before.
