The clone met his eyes. Peer did his best not to look relieved – short of severing ties with his body. He tried to read the clone’s expression, and failed; all he saw was a reflection of his own growing numbness. Pirandello had said it was impossible to feel any real emotion while staring into a mirror. Peer decided to take that as a good sign. They were still one person, after all – and that was the whole point.

Peer didn’t much care if they were found or not; all that really mattered to him was the fact that the City’s computational infrastructure was also constantly expanding, to enable it to keep up with both the growing population, and the ever-increasing demands of Elysian Standard Time. As long as that continued, his own tiny fraction of those resources also steadily increased. Immortality would have been meaningless, trapped in a “machine” with a finite number of possible states; in a finite time he would have exhausted the list of every possible thing he could be. Only the promise of eternal growth made sense of eternal life.

“I believe that we should wait for the equivalent moment in Lambertian history: when the Lambertians are impatient for proof of our existence – when our continued absence becomes far harder for them to explain than our arrival would be. Once they begin to suspect that we’re eavesdropping on every conversation they hold about us, it would be dishonest to remain concealed. Until then, we owe them the opportunity to find as many answers as they can, without us.”

The first thing I do when I meet a group of new students is (probably) to sit on the floor. I play low status, and I’ll explain that if the students fail they’re to blame me. Then they laugh, and relax, and I explain that really it’s obvious that they should blame me, since I’m supposed to be the expert; and if I give them the wrong material, they’ll fail; and if I give them the right material, then they’ll succeed. I play low status physically but my actual status is going up, since only a very confident and experienced person would put the blame for failure on himself.

people have a preferred status; that they like to be low, or high, and that they try to manoeuvre themselves into the preferred positions. A person who plays high status is saying ‘Don’t come near me, I bite.’ Someone who plays low status is saying ‘Don’t bite me, I’m not worth the trouble.’ In either case the status played is a defence, and it’ll usually work. It’s very likely that you will increasingly be conditioned into playing the status that you’ve found an effective defence. You become a status specialist, very good at playing one status, but not very happy or competent at playing the other. Asked to play the ‘wrong’ status, you’ll feel ‘undefended’.

Once the status becomes automatic, as it is in life, it’s possible to improvise complex scenes with no preparation at all. The status exercises are really crutches to support the actor so that instinctual systems can operate. The actor then feels that everything is easy, and he doesn’t experience himself as ‘acting’ any more than he does in life, even though the actual status he’s playing may be one very unfamiliar to him.

Non-defence is exploited by the wolf who exposes his neck and underbelly to a dominant wolf as a way of ending a losing battle. The top Wolf wants to bite, but can’t. Some Congolese soldiers dragged two white journalists out of a jeep, shot one and were about to shoot the other when he burst into tears.

This means that when two improvisers pass on a bare stage it may be possible to say where they are, even though they may not have decided on a location. The class will agree that the actors look as if they’re in a hospital corridor, or in a crowded street, or passing on a narrow pavement. We judge this from the distance at which they make the first eye contact, and from the moment that they ‘switch off’ from each other before passing. The class may not know why they imagine the actors in a particular environment, but there is often a general agreement.

I ask students (for homework!) to watch groups of people in coffee bars, and to notice how everyone’s attitude changes when someone leaves or joins a group. If you watch two people talking, and then wait for one to leave, you can see how the person remaining has to alter his posture. He had arranged his movements to relate to his partner’s, and now that he’s alone he has to change his position in order to express a relationship to the people around him.

Intelligence is proportional to population, but talent appears not to be related to population numbers. I’m living in a city at the edge of the Rocky Mountains; the population is much greater than it was in Shakespearian London, and almost everyone here is literate, and has had many thousands of dollars spent on his education. Where are the poets, and playwrights, and painters, and composers? Remember that there are hundreds of thousands of ‘literate’ people here, while in Shakespeare’s London very few people could read. The great art of this part of the world was the art of the native people. The whites flounder about trying to be ‘original’ and failing miserably.

Once the row was over and she had left, the playwright had a sensation of ‘failure’, or having done nothing—which was true. When I told the writer to consider the row as a routine which needed to be broken, she wrote a scene in which at the height of the row the girl suddenly injected the ex-boy friend with a syringe, and locked herself in the bathroom.

It’s the same kind of trick you use when you tell them that they are not their imaginations, that their imaginations have nothing to do with them, and that they’re in no way responsible for what their ‘mind’ gives them. In the end they learn how to abandon control while at the same time they exercise control. They begin to understand that everything is just a shell. You have to misdirect people to absolve them of responsibility. Then, much later, they become strong enough to resume the responsibility themselves.

In 1973, the FAA banned civilian supersonic flight over the United States. The ostensible reason was noise, although the activists responsible for the push enormously exaggerated it. One of the major avenues of technological improvement we rightly expected in the 1960s was faster airliners. 40 years of advancement in aeronautics would let us field supersonic airliners that were much quieter today; but the ban remains, in a classic Catch-22 where there are no actual sonic boom noise standards, but the FAA wants to see the airplane first and then they’ll decide on the rule. In this case, we got the double whammy of energy starvation and regulatory strangulation.

This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.

But the result was that the ruling has generally been interpreted as saying that regulators can do anything they want unless it is specifically prohibited in the enabling legislation. If a regulator charges you with a transgression, e.g. OSHA finds that your stair railings are 40 inches high instead of 42, even though there has never been any accident involving them, or that you have bags of ordinary beach sand that are not labelled “Poison,” [94]  you don’t get to challenge it in a real court; you must plead your case in the regulator’s own “administrative court.”

The world of antitrust is reminiscent of Alice’s Wonderland: everything seemingly is, yet apparently isn’t, simultaneously. It is a world in which competition is lauded as the basic axiom and guiding principle, yet "too much" competition is condemned as "cutthroat." It is a world in which actions designed to limit competition are branded as criminal when taken by businessmen, yet praised as "enlightened" when initiated by the government. It is a world in which the law is so vague that businessmen have no way of knowing whether specific actions will be declared illegal until they hear the judge’s verdict — after the fact. —Alan Greenspan

War ran out of steam as an effective selection mechanism around mid-20th century. Beginning with Korea, the battles were proxies done at arm’s length; the UN forces could (and did) bomb all the industry in North Korea to rubble, but it made no difference since the arms and materiel were coming from the USSR and China. The western world more or less froze the patterns of who was allowed to use what physical force upon whom in place.

The vast majority of the Eloi Agonistes who “believe in climate change” are not scientists who know anything about the enormously complex Earth climate system. They believe what they do because they have been told it by authority figures; they attach a moral significance to their beliefs; they believe that they are better people because they believe it. Belief in a human-caused climate apocalypse is a shibboleth in intellectual society. They react to skepticism not with careful self-searching reconsideration, but with the scathing inquisitions of heretic-hunters. This is a recipe for religious faith, not scientific knowledge.

So, of course, I had to make pine needle tea. I did while visiting Putzie Sunday, not that either of us were short on Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) but my curiosity was aroused. Result—fair. Not too wonderful, not too bad. About as good as regular tea, but different. Crush the pine needles up—pour on boiling water and allow to steep a while. Serve hot, or with ice and lemon. Cheap. Remarkable fact is it tastes like pine needles.

One gets the impression then that science is to be a set of pat formulas to standard questions. “What makes it move,” quickly all hands are eagerly raised, the lesson is learned, they are to say “Energy makes it move,” “Gravity makes it fall,” “The soles of our shoes wear out because of friction.” Just words, nothing is explained.

made it a point to be completely deferent to the Church hierarchy. At the Bishop’s summons he immediately switched off the lectern and dismissed the class without so much as completing the point under discussion. The students were not surprised; they knew he would do the same if any ordained priest had interrupted his class. It was, of course, immensely flattering to the priesthood to see how important they were in the eyes of the Filhos; but it also made it plain to them that any time they visited the school during teaching hours, classwork would be completely disrupted wherever they went. As a result, the priests rarely visited the school, and the Filhos, through extreme deference, maintained almost complete independence.

Fortunately, they had all been taught early twenty-first century English during their basic training; that language, or dialect, served as a temporal lingua franca through which a twenty-fifth century soldier could communicate with someone who had been a contemporary of his nineteen-times-great-grandparents.

I might be cleared for top secret, but I was also on a government contract and that meant conforming to all sorts of mandatory guidelines and stiff regulations. Kelly had operated in a paradise of innocence, long before EPA, OSHA, EEOC, or affirmative action and minority hiring policies became the laws of our land. I was forced by law to buy two percent of my materials from minority or disadvantaged businesses, but many of them couldn’t meet my security requirements. I also had to address EEOC requirements on equal employment opportunity and comply with other laws that required hiring a certain number of the disabled. Burbank was in a high-Latino community and I was challenged as to why I didn’t employ any Latino engineers. “Because they didn’t go to engineering school” was my only reply.

The reason for water’s high heat capacity has been a matter of debate — but please refer back to Figure 7.13. Radiant energy certainly raises water’s temperature, but some of that radiant energy is drawn off to build structure. That is, only some of the input energy goes toward heating. As a result, water needs to absorb a larger than expected amount of radiant energy in order to raise its temperature by some amount.

Salt and sugar crystals represent extremes of the like-likes-like mechanism. To produce sugar crystals, you dissolve sugar (sucrose) in water and heat the solution in the presence of an immersed seed crystal. As the water slowly cools and evaporates, a crystal forms. This “hard” crystal is known as rock candy. Its many opposing charges keep it solid. The presence of those charges can be confirmed by cracking the crystal in the dark (see figure). As the crystal breaks, the separated charges jump across the fracture, producing a discharge similar to lightning.

The most direct strategy for probing the insides of vesicles is simple: collect their contents to see whether the gathered molecules contain protons. We followed this strategy using the expedient of boiling. When water boils, bubbles break at the surface and their contents get expelled as vapor. We collected that vapor, condensed it into liquid, and measured the liquid’s pH. The pH progressively diminished with boiling time.

Fracturing probably results from excessive tension. To understand how this might happen, consider the equation governing tension on a thin membrane. For spherical membranes with thin walls, tension is given by the Laplace relation, T = Pr/2, where T is the membrane tension, P is the pressure difference across the membrane, and r is the radius. When a curved plane flattens, the radius of curvature, r, approaches infinity. The numerator of the equation can then become extremely large. Even a minor pressure difference across the membrane, P, will create enormous membrane tension. That small pressure differential might arise if, say, one of the two adjoining vesicles received slightly more radiant energy than its counterpart. Any such minor pressure difference can create huge tension. Then ... zap! The boundary fractures.

Curious about the possibility of reaching very high temperatures without boiling, my student Zheng Li took a smooth, asperity-free glass beaker and filled it with laboratory-grade, distilled, deionized water. EZ nucleation sites should have been rare or absent. He then applied heat. Even when the water was heated to well above the usual boiling temperature, no boiling was evident — until he threw in some dirt. Introducing those nucleation sites brought instant boiling. He got the same result when he inserted a stirring rod — instant boiling.

Once the vesicles stop popping, the clatter will subside. That happens when vesicles begin fusing rapidly enough to transition into bubbles. The bubbles produce a quieter sound as they break through the surface and open into the air. Each bubble-breakage event contributes to that gurgling sound.

There’s more. If you look at Figure 15.1, you will notice that the vapor does not rise uniformly; a series of “puffs” ascend, one after another. The surface seems to emit vapor puffs one at a time. Each puff comprises numerous vesicles, and each vesicle comprises huge numbers of water molecules. Hence, astronomical numbers of water molecules rise with each belch.

We soon noticed that the tubes rose only from limited regions of the surface. One region might emit a cloud or unleash a strand, while regions immediately adjacent might produce nothing at all — no detectable evaporation. The discharging zones might shift over time, but, at any given point in time, a cloud would emerge only from limited regions of the surface.

Those evaporated vesicles, often called aerosol droplets, may eventually condense to form clouds. The water contained in those clouds can be massively heavy: an atmospheric science colleague estimates the weight of clouds not in terms of kilograms but in terms of easier to fathom units: elephants. In a large cumulonimbus cloud, the total aerosol droplet weight can amount to fifteen million elephants.

A familiar example of this electrostatic lifting force may be seen in waterfalls. Descending water creates a mist of droplets that rise upward, forming clouds. Such clouds can rise above the tops of the falls (Fig. 15.14). Since droplets cannot mechanically rebound higher than the height from which they started, some other force is implied,

Many of the men and women I see in my practice find it particularly difficult to introduce this kind of emotional space into their loving relationships. You would think that the safety of an established base would make it easier to take these kinds of risks, but no. A secure relationship does indeed give us the courage to act on our professional ambitions, to confront family secrets, and to take the skydiving course we never dared consider before. Yet we balk at the idea of establishing distance within the relationship itself—the very place that grants us the delicious togetherness in the first place. We can tolerate space anywhere but there.

HUXLEY, MAN’S PLACE IN NATURE (1863) Symmetry and Polarity In addition to the repetition of modular parts, animal bodies and body parts usually display two additional features—symmetry and polarity. Most familiar animals are bilaterally symmetrical in that they have matching right and left sides with a central axis of symmetry running down the middle of the long axis of the body. This design also imposes a front/rear orientation to animals and has enabled the evolution of many efficient modes of locomotion. Some animals exhibit other symmetries, such as the pentaradial (five-fold) echinoderms,

Spemann used a fine baby’s hair, taken from his own daughter, to tie off and separate individual halves of the embryo. The cells on each side of the knot gave rise to normal newt tadpoles, demonstrating that the two halves of early amphibian embryos could give rise to two entirely identical animals.

Polydactyly is known widely throughout vertebrates, especially in cats, mice, and chickens. It is striking that similar digit patterns can occur in different animals, including humans, and they can be induced by experimental manipulations or inherited. This suggested that there could be some mechanisms in common for generating extra human fingers and chicken digits.

The significance of the evolutionary reduction in jaw musculature extends beyond how hominins chewed their food. Muscle anatomy has a large influence on bone growth, and experimental studies have shown that jaw muscle growth has a significant impact on the size and shape of the craniofacial skeleton. Reduction in the jaw musculature, and the force imposed on the mandible, would reduce the stress on bones in the skull. This could have allowed the braincase to become thinner and larger.

we cannot say whether this inactivating mutation was the initial genetic change toward reduction of the temporalis, or one of many sequential or parallel changes, or the last change that occurred once the role of the MYH16 protein in the temporalis became dispensable.

the human FOXP2 protein differs at only 4 out of 716 positions from that of the mouse, at 3 positions from the FOXP2 of the orangutan, and at just 2 positions from those of the gorilla and chimpanzee. This is a smaller amount of change in sequence than most proteins show, indicating that there has been a lot of pressure to conserve the FOXP2 protein sequence throughout mammalian evolution.

what is called a “selective sweep.” The action of natural selection can leave a trail of evidence in the form of the pattern of DNA sequence variation that arises after a favorable mutation is selected for. Variation in a length of DNA sequence accumulates as a function of time unless or until selection acts to favor a particular variant. Selection for a variant causes a “sweep” that reduces overall variation.

The signal of a selective sweep at the human FOXP2 locus is one of the strongest at any human gene. This is a good indication that for some period of the past 200,000 years, during the evolution of our species, mutations in the FOXP2 gene were favored and spread throughout H. sapiens.

But that is not the conclusion they will draw.” “And what about the disgrace to the Institute in the eyes of the men of intelligence, wherever such may be left?” “Why should we worry about them?” Dr. Stadler could have regarded the sentence as conceivable, had it been uttered with hatred, envy or malice; but the absence of any such emotion, the casual ease of the voice, an ease suggesting a chuckle, hit him like a moment’s glimpse of a realm that could not be taken as part of reality; the thing spreading down to his stomach was cold terror.

Standing alone in his half-darkened room, Rearden noted that the prospect of going to jail left him blankly indifferent. He remembered the time when, aged fourteen, faint with hunger, he would not steal fruit from a sidewalk stand. Now, the possibility of being sent to jail—if this dinner was a felony—meant no more to him than the possibility of being run over by a truck: an ugly physical accident without any moral significance.

Before long, I began to view escapism as a guilty pleasure: fun and addictive, but unsatisfying. Things like hiking and going to parties became almost a chore: I superficially enjoyed them, sure, but I yearned to be elsewhere, doing something permanent. Even reading fiction took on a pang of guilt. I valued things that moved me forward, that honed my skills or moved me closer to my terminal goals. I wanted to be building things, improving things.

When I was quite young, one of the guests at our house refused to eat processed food. I remember that I offered her some fritos and she refused. I was fairly astonished, and young enough to be socially inept. I asked, incredulous, how someone could not like fritos. To my surprise, she didn't brush me off or feed me banal lines about how different people have different tastes. She gave me the answer of someone who had recently stopped liking fritos through an act of will. Her answer went something like this: "Just start noticing how greasy they are, and how the grease gets all over your fingers and coats the inside of the bag. Notice that you don't want to eat things soaked in that much grease. Become repulsed by it, and then you won't like them either."

I live with two close friends. This meant that social contact was never out of reach. Even when spending an entire day sequestered in my room pouring over a textbook I was able to maintain a small amount of social interaction. If ever I had a spare hour and a thirst for company, I found it readily available. My primary partner was, up until early 2014, going to school full time while holding down a full time job. Thus, her schedule was more restrictive than my own and we had been working around it for some time. Our relationship was not further constrained by my efforts. My core friend groups knew and respected what I was doing. I was more tense and exhausted than usual, but I had warned my friends to expect this and no friendships suffered as a result.

This tendency to see patterns in randomness is occasionally harmful. In tests where a green light is lit up 80% of the time (according to some random process) and a red light is lit up the other 20% of the time, where the subject must guess which light will be lit up, rats and pigeons always pick green while humans try to predict the pattern. In these scenarios, the rats (who always guess green) are right 80% of the time, while the humans (who tend to guess green 80% of the time but not the right 80% of the time) are correct only about 68% of the time.

In part, this gave me a greater appreciation of small large numbers like a hundred. But mostly, it lowered my bar for what counts as a "large number". Which worked, in a way — my subconscious now has a much deeper respect for large numbers in that it finds anything greater than a few dozen to be tediously huge. When I encounter big numbers (such as, say, fifty three), it sort of throws up its hands and says "this is like that thing with the dice — way too big for it to be worth my time to comprehend."

How much does he actually care about wars that ravage nations? About neglected, deprived children? About the future of humanity? He actually cares about these things to the tune of much more money than he has, and much more time than he has. For the first time, Daniel sees a glimpse of of how much he actually cares, and how poor a state the world is in. This has the strange effect that Daniel's reasoning goes full-circle, and he realizes that he actually can't care about oiled birds to the tune of 3 minutes or $3: not because the birds aren't worth the time and money (and, in fact, he thinks that the economy produces things priced at $3 which are worth less than the bird's survival), but because he can't spend his time or money on saving the birds.

The end of an era in physics does not always announce itself with thunder and trumpets; more often it begins with what seems like a small, small flaw . . . But because physicists have this arrogant idea that their models should work all the time, not just most of the time, they follow up on small flaws. Usually, the small flaw goes away under closer inspection. Rarely, the flaw widens to the point where it blows up the whole theory. Therefore it is written: “If you do not seek perfection you will halt before taking your first steps.”

When you argue a lot, people look upon you as confrontational. If you repeatedly refuse to compromise, it’s even worse. Consider it as a question of tribal status: scientists have certainly earned some extra status in exchange for such socially useful tools as medicine and cellphones. But this social status does not justify their insistence that only scientific ideas on evolution be taught in public schools. Priests also have high social status, after all. Scientists are getting above themselves—they won a little status, and now they think they’re chiefs of the whole tribe! They ought to be more humble, and compromise a little.

It is dangerous to have a prescriptive principle which you only vaguely comprehend; your mental picture may have so many degrees of freedom that it can adapt to justify almost any deed.

Where people have vague mental models that can be used to argue anything, they usually end up believing whatever they started out wanting to believe.

“Humility” is a virtue that is often misunderstood. This doesn’t mean we should discard the concept of humility, but we should be careful using it. It may help to look at the actions recommended by a “humble” line of thinking, and ask: “Does acting this way make you stronger, or weaker?”

If you think about the problem of induction as applied to a bridge that needs to stay up, it may sound reasonable to conclude that nothing is certain no matter what precautions are employed; but if you consider the real-world difference between adding a few extra cables, and shrugging, it seems clear enough what makes the stronger bridge.

Humility, in its most commonly misunderstood form, is a fully general excuse not to believe something; since, after all, you can’t be sure. Beware of fully general excuses!
