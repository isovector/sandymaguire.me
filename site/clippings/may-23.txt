Rimmer moaned constantly. He couldn't understand how the Space Corps could spend zillions upon zillions of dollarpounds designing a ship the size of Red Dwarf, and not put a couple of buckquid to one side for the fitting of a 'start' button. Just one little red button marked 'blast off'. How much would that have set them back? Kryten pointed out repeatedly that Red Dwarf wasn't designed to stop. The nearest the ship ever came to rest was when it went into orbit around a planet. The idea that it might one day come to a grinding halt had never occurred to anyone. The explanation seemed to matter little to Rimmer, who kept on obsessively calculating the prices of small, plastic buttons. Even the most expensive button, Rimmer surmised, even one that came in a futuristicky kind of shape, carved from rhinoceros tusk, with 'blast off' hand-painted by Leonardo da Vinci in radioactive gold dust, couldn't have cost all that much. Kryten patiently explained that it probably wasn't so much the design of the button that had proved too expensive, but more the vast network of computer relays and the thousands of miles of cables the button would have to be connected to, that made it prohibitive. But Rimmer wasn't interested.

Trillions upon trillions of tiny marine organisms that most of us have never heard offoraminiferans and coccoliths and calcareous algaecapture atmospheric carbon, in the form of carbon dioxide, when it falls as rain and use it (in combination with other things) to make their tiny shells. By locking the carbon up in their shells, they keep it from being reevaporated into the atmosphere, where it would build up dangerously as a greenhouse gas. Eventually all the tiny foraminiferans and coccoliths and so on die and fall to the bottom of the sea, where they are compressed into limestone.

In the Soviet Navy there were three routes to advancement. A man could become a zampolit and be a pariah among his peers. Or he could be a navigation officer and advance to his own command. Or he could be shunted into a specialty in which he would gain rank and pay—but never command. Thus a chief engineer on a Soviet naval vessel could outrank his commanding officer and still be his subordinate.

Regardless of category, however, the freedom to copy and redistribute noncommercially should remain unabridged at all times, Stallman insists.

he divides the world into three categories. The first category involves “functional” works – e.g., software programs, dictionaries, and textbooks. The second category involves works that might best be described as “testimonial” – e.g., scientific papers and historical documents. Such works serve a purpose that would be undermined if subsequent readers or authors were free to modify the work at will. It also includes works of personal expression – e.g., diaries, journals, and autobiographies. To modify such documents would be to alter a person’s recollections or point of view, which Stallman considers ethically unjustifiable. The third category includes works of art and entertainment.

“Most of the time when people consider the question of what rules society should have for using software, the people considering it are from software companies, and they consider the question from a self-serving perspective,” says Stallman, opening his speech. “What rules can we impose on everybody else so they have to pay us lots of money? I had the good fortune in the 1970s to be part of a community of programmers who shared software. And because of this I always like to look at the same issue from a different direction to ask: what kind of rules make possible a good society that is good for the people who are in it?

the dividing line separating Linux developers from GNU developers was largely generational. Many Linux hackers, like Torvalds, had grown up in a world of proprietary software. They had begun contributing to free software without perceiving any injustice in nonfree software. For most of them, nothing was at stake beyond convenience. Unless a program was technically inferior, they saw little reason to reject it on licensing issues alone.

If a boy did show his emotions, his male friends would react by making fun of him, telling jokes, or ignoring or distracting him. The victim of these attacks appreciated this: Being made fun of helped him to calm down. According to these boys, this type of reaction showed that their friends cared about them. Many boys taunt one another not to bully each other but to help each other out, to teach each other how to deal with the world most beneficially.

Because fear signals potential danger, women should be particularly sensitive to nonverbal use. Indeed, women’s advantage over men in decoding nonverbal cues is greatest with fear [40]. The same logic should also apply to expressions of anger by individuals, although this is more difficult to study. Anger signals potential threat. Therefore, women should be particularly attuned to nonverbal cues of anger, since this would allow them to escape attack more rapidly.

If not, the one not smiled at begins to ruminate. “Why didn’t she smile at me?” “Did I do something wrong?” “Is my dress on backward?” “Who does she think she is, anyway?” “I remember another time she did something unpleasant.” “My other friend, Jane, thinks she’s not very nice, and after all maybe she’s right. This proves it.” And so it goes.

If another man is trying to compete, he generally does it in public. He openly bests his competitor, then helps himself to his competitor’s food—or his wife.

Should a woman achieve success, she may never mention it [42, 44]. As I described in chapter 5, there is a strong female taboo against discussing personal success. Instead of speaking of their many achievements, successful women focus on something that is not going well, some weakness that is of concern. There is always something that is not right.

“Anyone could have done as well. I work so hard because I know I’m really not very smart.…” Anne thinks, as do many women, that if she competes with other women she will be abandoned. Her fears of loneliness and isolation, of being thought by other women to be self-absorbed and selfish, overwhelm her.

Their favorite hobby was having a boyfriend. Jenny wasn’t really interested in a boyfriend, but she still like hanging out with the guys. Mostly she liked to play soccer and basketball with them after school. She liked to wear jeans and T-shirts instead of make-up and miniskirts.

Even where fathers take care of children, many are not certain how old their child is, what day their child was born, where to find their child’s doctor, or the name of their child’s teacher [14]. None of these fathers, however, has any memory problems when it comes to recalling the names, ages, and statistics of the players on their favorite sports team.

a careful inspection shows that fathers can be distractible when it comes to children. While a father may dutifully push his baby’s carriage, his attention is easily distracted by a pretty girl walking by, deliberations with fellow fathers about last night’s baseball game, or a new business deal.

Boys, regardless of whether they are educated, grow up to be men, who just don’t invest as much in their families. Often, men will choose to spend their money on alcohol and tobacco or leisure activities as much as on their families. As the UNICEF millennium report [25] on the importance of education to girls states: Some 121 million children are not in school, most of them

I always suggest that my female students, who attend a college that is predominantly female, simply dispense with monogamy. Rather, they should either live together with their children or join in a polygynous (several co-wives, one husband) marriage in some other country. Living in a harem makes sense. There are many advantages. First, all the co-wives can share an excellent man; none of them has to settle for second best. None has to fear never marrying at all.

A girl then undergoes a psychological transformation from reliance upon her mother as authority figure to becoming the authority figure for her daughters, and perhaps even her grandchildren. Boys and men live embedded in a world of relative equals, mostly unrelated to one another, who combat the enemy and join in activities together, competing over small variations in status.

In business and science, high-status women invest less than high-status men in lower-status same-sex individuals [181, 182, 4]. Recently, my colleagues and I asked young women and men how much money they would share with a less powerful same-sex ally with whom they had worked on a joint project. Women gave much less than men did

Fathers needn’t bother with these complex calculations. They know the mother of their children will almost always be there for the children. Of course, around the world, stealing another man’s wife or girlfriend is probably the number one cause of murder within a community [192], even in hunter-gatherer societies [22]. But a man doesn’t worry as much about this, as long as his wife can care for his children.

should I start with the very basics?” I dislike rhetorical questions, so whenever I hear one I always give the less expected answer.  “No, you should skip straight to the most advanced part without any preliminaries.”
