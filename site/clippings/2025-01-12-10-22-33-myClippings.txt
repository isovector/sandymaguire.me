Those seven, according to the current astronomy, included the sun and the moon, but not the earth.

When Christianity first took root in the Roman Empire, pious Church Fathers worried over the survival of the pagan gods in the names of the planets that governed the Christian week. The Eastern Church had some success in exterminating this pagan influence: the names of the days in both modern Greek and Russian ceased to be planetary.

Under the Roman Republic they became so powerful and so unpopular that in 139 B.C. they were expelled not only from Rome but from all Italy.

Until the telescope, the defenders of Christian orthodoxy felt no need to ban Copernican ideas.

Estienne’s use of the “best authors” provided the means by which lexicographers set up their standards of correctness for the new national languages. The first comprehensive standard dictionary in a single language, a product of twenty years of work by the Accademia della Crusca, appeared in Venice in 1612 and offered the pattern for other authoritative monolingual European dictionaries. The leader in this project, Leonardo Salviati (1540–1589), used the power of the press to legislate the Tuscan dialect into the standard Italian language. He drew from the great writers of Florence, canonized Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, and so made theirs the language for an Italian nation still three centuries in the future. Some say it was the Italian language that created the nation.

“Standard” English was established empirically and by individuals, by contrast with the product elsewhere of state-supported academies. Since the early English Protestants wanted to help ordinary readers understand the Bible in English, the mainstream of English lexicography, as Allen Walker Read explains, flowed from the lists of words collected to help the devout. One of the first such lists was appended to William Tyndale’s English translation of the Pentateuch in 1530.

People learning object-oriented programming often complain that the systems they’re working with use inheritance in convoluted ways and that it’s difficult to follow the flow of control.

Another important change over the past year has been a greater emphasis on the problem that a pattern solves. It’s easiest to see a pattern as a solution, as a technique that can be adapted and reused. It’s harder to see when it is appropriate—to characterize the problems it solves and the context in which it’s the best solution. In general, it’s easier to see what someone is doing than to know why, and the “why” for a pattern is the problem it solves.

The Alexandrian point of view has helped us focus on design trade-offs—the different “forces” that help shape a design. His influence made us work harder to understand the applicability and consequences of our patterns. It also kept us from worrying about defining a formal representation of patterns. Although such a representation might make automating patterns possible, at this stage it’s more important to explore the space of design patterns than to formalize it

James Coplien’s Advanced C++: Programming Styles and Idioms [Cop92] has influenced us, too. The patterns in his book tend to be more C++-specific than our design patterns, and his book contains lots of lower-level patterns as well. But there is some overlap, as we point out in our patterns.

Some look at my binary-search algorithm and ask why the loop always runs to the end without checking whether it's found the target. In fact, this is the correct behavior; the math is beyond the scope of this chapter, but with a little work, you should be able to get an intuitive feeling for it—and this is the kind of intuition I've observed in some of the great programmers I've worked with.
Let's think about the progress of the loop. Suppose you have n elements in the array, where n is some really large number. The chance of finding the target the first time through is 1/n, a really small number. The next iteration (after you divide the search set in half) is 1/(n/2)—still small—and so on. In fact, the chance of hitting the target becomes significant only when you're down to 10 or 20 elements, which is to say maybe the last four times through the loop.

Part of the reason that young software engineers should cut their teeth debugging complicated systems is that it inculcates a lifelong skill: the ability to analyze a solution to a problem in terms of the ways that it won't work instead of the ways that it might—the ability to focus on the edge conditions. When conceiving of new software, we software engineers should not try to convince ourselves why our design will work; we should invalidate the reasons why it will not.

There are places where it could be more bookish, or where code could blend in more, for example. Sure, we'd like to clean those up, but while we like pretty code, we like clean merges even better. Changes to variable names, whitespace, line breaks, and so forth can be more of an obstacle to merging than logic changes.

Develop a "let's go see!" attitude.
Throughout your career people will approach you with all manner of real-life problems they will have observed on devices or equipment for which you have responsibility. A wonderfully effective response, both technically and administratively, is to invite them to have a look with you — i.e., "Let's go see!" It is seldom adequate to remain at one's desk and speculate about causes and solutions, or to retreat to drawings, specifications, and reports and hope to sort it all out. Before ever being able to solve a problem, you will need abundant insight, insight that can only be developed by observing first-hand what might be at once too subtle and complex only to imagine (Ferguson, p. 56).

It is usually intended to serve only as a guideline, one that will have been formulated without benefit of the new information that will be discovered during its execution. The rule therefore is to keep others, your manager included, informed of what you have done, at reasonable intervals, and ask for approval of any well-considered and properly planned deviations that you may have conceived.
