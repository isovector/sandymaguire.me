Relative to night owls, who stay up late, people today who are morning larks, and get up early, tend to have higher income, higher academic achievement, and to be less often unemployed, in ill health, impulsive, or undependable. Larks are more conformist, agreeable, and conscientious, although less smart. These suggest that ems tend more to be larks than owls. Women and older people tend more to be larks

Such ems are more strategic and careful in choosing the details of their career paths. They more often ask for things they want, even if rejection seems likely. They are more willing to sacrifice likeability to be seen as tough. They try harder to, and are better at, developing their network of useful social connections.

Ems can afford to have many children and young trainees compete, and then only select a best few to be allocated into jobs, with the failures ending or retiring. One might think that such low odds of success are demoralizing, but overconfident neglect of the chances of failure is aided by the fact that most ems remember almost always succeeding against the odds.

Young ems see the important part of their lives as their future peak productivity years, and one of the great questions of their life is whether they will live up to hopes about them and become one of the few greatly copied ems when they reach peak productivity.

People such as Yevgeny Zamyatin, author of the classic novel We, feared that the entire social world would soon be factory-like, and that firms and nations would soon merge into intrusive faceless oppressors that dictated who people married, where they lived, what they ate, when they slept, and pretty much everything (Richter 1893; Zamyatin 1924). Discomfort with big organizations lingers in our stereotypes of “soul-crushing” bureaucracies.

To maximize the motivation generated by this scoreboard, whenever I reached an important milestone in an academic paper (e.g., solving a key proof), I would circle the tally mark corresponding to the hour where I finished the result.* This served two purposes. First, it allowed me to connect, at a visceral level, accumulated deep work hours and tangible results. Second, it helped calibrate my expectations for how many hours of deep work were needed per result. This reality (which was larger than I first assumed) helped spur me to squeeze more such hours into each week.
