Hi there! You've unwittingly stumbled upon We Can Solve This, the "experimental
lifestyle project" of Sandy Maguire. It used to just be my blog, but then I
somehow convinced the Lithuanian government to give me a visa based solely on
its merits, and so here we are.

You can find me [on GitHub][github], [on Last.fm][lastfm], and [on
goodreads][goodreads].

I might best be described somewhere between *independent researcher* and
*voluntarily-unemployed bum*. At the ripe old age of 27 I decided to quit my
highly-lucrative engineering job and decide to focus more on living than on
grinding for the man.  It's what you might call a work in progress.

In my copious spare time, I build clocks, write software libraries, design video
games, and play lots of music. Ostensibly I'm writing a book about the folklore
behind mathematical engineering. I also maintain another blog that's dives more
into the inside baseball of building cool things.

Some things I've done in past lives include being an early engineer at
[Formation][takt], building blazingly-fast compilers at Google, and accidentally
making Facebook a lot of money. Despite being retired, I might be interested in
helping you with any of these things too, so [get in touch][email].

[takt]: https://formation.ai/
[email]: mailto:sandy@sandymaguire.me

I hold a Bachelors Degree in Honors Software Engineering from the University of
Waterloo, which is a fantastic school that I recommend you attend.

Originally I come from very northern Canada, but have since lived in ten cities
throughout four different countries. Currently I'm located in Vilnius,
Lithuania, and before you ask why, it's because I like it here. Go figure.

Want to talk? Feel free to [email me][email]. I'd love to hear from you!
