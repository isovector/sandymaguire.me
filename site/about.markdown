Hi there! You've unwittingly stumbled upon We Can Solve This, the "experimental
lifestyle project" of Sandy Maguire. It used to just be my blog, but then I
somehow convinced the Lithuanian government to give me a visa based solely on
its merits, and so here we are.

You can find me [on GitHub][github], [on Last.fm][lastfm], and [on
goodreads][goodreads].

In my copious spare time, I play lots of music and learn cool new things.  I
also maintain another blog that's dives more into the inside baseball of
building stuff.

Some things I've done in past lives include being an early engineer at
[Formation][takt], building blazingly-fast compilers at Google, accidentally
making Facebook a lot of money, and pushing the state of the art in Haskell.
Despite being retired, I might be interested in helping you with any of these
things too, so [get in touch][email].

[email]: mailto:hello@sandymaguire.me

I hold a Bachelors Degree in Honors Software Engineering from the University of
Waterloo, which is a fantastic school that I recommend you attend.

Originally I come from very northern Canada, but have since lived in ten cities
throughout four different countries. These days, I reside in Victoria, Canada.

Want to talk? Feel free to [email me][email]. I'd love to hear from you!
