    <p>(This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>.)</p>

    <p>Oops --- I forgot to update my "now" page for over two years! I put it into my calendar to remember to update weekly, but we'll see if that actually happens.</p>
<p>The biggest update is that Erin and I are engaged! In a daring show of love, I moved all the furniture out of our apartment and screwed with the breaker box so we had to light candles. Then we wandered around a visual representation of our relationship, complete with chat logs, photos and journal entries. She said yes!</p>
<p>In other news, we're leaving Victoria in three short weeks, off to travel the world. And we've started selling things already, which is nice on the not-being-stressed front, but clearly premature. Everything went SO QUICKLY and now we don't have any furniture and the place is in shambles.</p>
<p>Leaving Victoria is bittersweet. It hasn't been ALL THAT MUCH FUN during cov, but as of last week covid is over, and I just feel like I'm starting to find my people. I've put together more community in the last three weeks than in the two years before that, which is good for a lonely soul, but it's all just in time to leave.</p>
<p>Part of that community has been building the local FP meetup. It's been a few months in the making, and we had a major breakthrough last night --- seven people, all of whom had fun and promised to come back! My peer pressuring skills have finally come in handy for more than getting people out to karaoke; turns out, they're useful for bullying cool people into building community with me.</p>
