    <p>(This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>.)</p>

    <p>Another year, another "now" page.</p>
<p>Life has been picking up steam lately. All of a sudden I find myself writing a book, being in pre-production for another, planning a wedding, dealing with the influx of PhD programs that would love to have me, building cool new technology at work, automating our smart home, putting a talk together for a conference, and physically jumping over lots of static structures.</p>
<p>In some sense, it's exhausting, but also an exhilarating change of pace from the last few years. It's <em>nice</em> to be busy --- especially with interesting projects.</p>
<p>The stuff I'm most excited about right now is parkour. I unlocked something inside myself this week: the realization that I haven't been trying very hard thus far. I've been managing to do OK on raw talent and a lifetime of climbing things. And I realize I've just been sorta coasting at parkour: trying things, but not trying <em>that hard.</em> And more interestingly, not even noticing that I wasn't trying that hard. But something unlocked, and I was able to give it significantly more effort than I had been previously. And it's got me wondering if I've been phoning it in everywhere in my life?</p>
<p>That's not a depressing thought; it's an inspiring one.</p>
<p>It looks like grad school is a go. I have at least two offers, and I suspect at least one more is in the pipes. That's wildly exciting, and now means I need to do the hard work of picking a program. The tradeoffs are widely incomparable, between compensation, adviser fit, short-term location, long-term location (by the end of the program I'm going to be nearly 40!), commute times, and competativeness, to name a few. I don't really know what my strategy is going to be, but I suspect it will involve math.</p>
<p>Ironically, I haven't yet written about my new year's goal of being a <strong>Man of Action,</strong> which is more of a theme than a goal. But the idea is that whenever I see an opportunity for action, I should aspire to take it. It's been a really great change of pace: from sending back food, to standing up for my right to sit down, to returning expired yogurt. Lots of trivial inconveniences that a less-assertive person (like me a few months ago) would accept and grumble about, that instead I am dealing with. And I guess I'm also updating my now page. Look at that; action all around.</p>
