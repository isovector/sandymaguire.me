    <p>(This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>.)</p>

    <p>I am really awful at this "now" stuff. Here is some "then" stuff to make up the difference:</p>
<p>Erin and I landed a great place in our desired neighborhood. It was super easy, barely an inconvenience to find. Nice. I've been trying to get socially oriented in Vancouver, and making good progress, but everyone has JOBS which means they can only hang out in the evenings, which dramatically reduces the time I can be social. Oh well.</p>
<p>Some friends and I are attempting to formalize probability/utility theory in Agda. They have a longer term goal of generalizing it to quantum amplitudes, but for me, it's just fun hacking on math stuff with the homies. It's made me very aware of just how much math/Agda I know, which I think might turn into a cool NaNoWriMo project. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Besides that, I'm officially employed again. Wire liked my work, and re-extended my contract. It's been lovely having some external structure. Wire gets two days a week, and there is some talk of a few other projects that might want some of my days as well. Working again is neat; it's not full time or anything, but nice to not need to worry about the bills, and to have enough agency on projects that I don't get bored.</p>
<p>The remainder of my time is (attempting) to do some research in a grad-student capacity. I'm not in the program yet, but admissions haven't started and I thought it might be nice to sync up with a professor to see if we work well together. I think a PhD is in the cards, but it's a bit scary because last time didn't go so well. Never trying again I think is the wrong lesson to take away from failures though, so I will persevere even if it's unpleasant.</p>
<p>My search engine is happily chugging away still. I haven't worked on it much in the last six weeks. At some point the index got too big to be useful, which is a fascinating turn of events, and really one I should write about.</p>
