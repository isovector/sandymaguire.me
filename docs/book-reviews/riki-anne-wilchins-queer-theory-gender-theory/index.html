<article>
    <p>I picked this up mostly as a joke after learning that iced coffee and walking quickly are queer symbols. While researching whether or not I was queer for liking iced coffee (and wondering if this is what my San Francisco friends meant when they said they were queer,) I came across this book, and was surprised to learn that there is a THEORY behind being queer! Fascinating!<br /><br />After a quick wikipedia-job on queer theory that didn't prove to be helpful in the least, I thought I should probably read a book on the topic. Either it would be informative, or it would be further evidence that the humanities are full of crazy people spouting off on "theories" that are completely impenetrable -- win/win, really.<br /><br />So I dove in during a long bus ride. And I was pleasantly surprised! Wilchins makes a good argument that it's stupid to draw strong dichotomies based on sexuality. Does it make a man a homosexual if he thinks about kissing another man? Not only is this not right, argues Wilchins, it's not even wrong. These categories are useful insofar as they help us predict the future, but they are not helpful as _identifiers._<br /><br />I don't remember much else about the book. I ran out of steam on it. I never intended to abandon it, but I did, and I have no desire to read more. Queer Theory was significantly less shit than I was expecting it to be! I remember being impressed with a few of the arguments while reading it, but damned if I can remember what they are now.</p>
