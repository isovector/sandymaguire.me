<article>
    <p>A few weeks ago I wrote <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/monotonous-web/">a little ditty</a> about how awful the internet has gotten, compared with the web of my youth. It garnered much more attention than my usual musings, and, as a result, <em>lots</em> of people chimed in. They shared with me great websites, sympathies, and <em>tons of unsolicted advice,</em> some of which actually happened to be good!</p>
<p>The good news: I was right — there still is tons of cool stuff on the web; it’s just hard to track down if you aren’t already in the know. This post collects all the stuff I’ve learned recently about finding cool stuff on the web in 2022.</p>
<h2 id="the-small-web">The Small Web</h2>
<p>Turns out there’s a name for this thing I’ve been seeking, it’s called the <a href="https://ar.al/2020/08/07/what-is-the-small-web/">small web</a>. The small web is a bunch of decentralized individuals who want to use the internet as a medium of self expression, where they can do weird and wonderful things. Like the <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website">low tech magazine</a>, whose website runs on solar panels and therefore might be offline. Or the guy who <a href="https://digdeeper.club/articles/browsers.xhtml">reviews the privacy policies of web browsers</a>. Or this dude who puts way <a href="https://coffeeadastra.com/2019/08/04/an-in-depth-analysis-of-coffee-filters-2/">more effort into making coffee</a> than has ever been justified. Or, how about a website dedicated to <a href="https://www.glorioustrainwrecks.com/">really awful video games?</a> Or, my personal favorite, the implementation of <a href="https://coral.shoes/nojs/">cooker clicker using no javascript</a>.</p>
<p>Amazing stuff, truly.</p>
<p>So, where does the small web hang out? A huge chunk of it is on <a href="https://neocities.org/browse">neocities</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">geocities</a> for the modern age.) Haphazardly clicking around on neocities, however, shows that <em>not everything on the small web is a gem!</em> There are a ton of angsty teens’ homepages. But that’s OK. We used to call being online <em>surfing the net</em> because you’d sometimes catch a cool wave, but most of the time be waiting around in the deep hoping for something interesting to come along. It was a lot more experimental, both on the side of content creators, and for consumers. On the consumer side, you spent a lot of time hitting the back button.</p>
<p>Per capita, there are far fewer teens hanging out on the <a href="https://tildeverse.org/members/">tildeverse</a>, which is allegedly a loose collection of old-school *nix hackers and academics. The stuff I found there is a little more polished, but <em>significantly less weird.</em> It’s the sort of place you find arcane technical blogs and professors’ websites which haven’t been updated since the 90s — that is, if you can find anything at all. Tilde sites are often a byproduct of being a user on a shared computing system, many of whom are members for reasons other than to host a website. I personally haven’t found much on the tildeverse, but several of my friends swear by it.</p>
<p>The reliably best stuff I’ve found, however, has all come from webrings, which are a bygone piece of web history/technology. A webring is a what it sounds like: a ring of websites, each with a “next website” link. Webrings are a great way of rapidly getting to bizarre parts of the internet; keep hitting “next” until something tickles your fancy. <a href="https://george.gh0.pw/">GEORGE</a> is a particularly weird one, and something that’s very clearly <em>not</em> an artifact of the boring-ass <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/monotonous-web/">monotonous web.</a> I haven’t managed to find a webring-webring — that is, a webring whose constituent members are themselves webrings — which is very clearly a huge opportunity in the market. Someone get on it! However, I did find a <a href="https://indieweb.org/webring#Examples">list of webrings</a> which isn’t nearly as satisfying a concept.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-search-engines">Alternative Search Engines</h2>
<p>You probably already know about Google and Bing. And maybe even Yandex. Lots of people yelled at me in my last blog post for not knowing about <a href="https://searx.github.io/searx/">searx</a>, which isn’t particularly relevant to my gripes, but in the words of a <a href="https://vancouverguardian.com/vancouver-comedy-jon-endo/">comedian I just met</a>: “it is what it is.”</p>
<p>That stuff’s all tired and blase. Have you heard of <a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/">marginalia</a>, which lets you control which categories of websites you’re looking for. Or how about <a href="https://gigablast.com/">gigablast</a>, which combats dead links by finding archived versions of them? Or how about <a href="https://www.mojeek.com/">mojeek</a>, which <a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2021/03/10/search-engines-with-own-indexes/">seirdy</a> figures is the best alternative search engine out there?</p>
<p>Turns out there’s a ton of innovation in this space, along which lines I have a personal announcement to make some time in the near future. But that’s getting ahead of myself.</p>
<h2 id="combating-the-monotonous-web">Combating the Monotonous Web</h2>
<p>After a month of exploring weird stuff on the internet, I’ve realized that the number one way that webmasters (to use a throwback term) can help combat the monotonous web is to just link to sites you think are cool.</p>
<p>You’ll notice there are more links in this post than usual. That’s not by accident.</p>
<p>Search engines discover sites by automating surfing — that is, they just click every link on every page, and see what they find in the process. On a more human level, if you like my stuff, you’re pretty likely to like the stuff I like. And so, to be part of the change, here are some websites I find unusually interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html">Paul Graham’s essays</a> — fascinating musings on doing important work with your life.</li>
<li><a href="https://mitxela.com">mitxela</a> who makes weird and delightful DIY gadgets</li>
<li><a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/archive/">Bob Nystrom</a> — high quality blog posts on game design and the mechanics of writing books</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.plover.com/">Mark Jason Dominus</a> for whom there are no words. A true 21st century polymath, whose blog spans from etymology to abstract math.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/original-sequences">LessWrong</a> which taught me most things I know about the art of thinking.</li>
<li><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/about/">Slate Star Codex</a> which taught me how to write, and whose clarity of thought I aspire towards.</li>
<li><a href="https://dominiccummings.com/">Dominic Cummings</a> who gives an unprecedented look behind the usually closed-doors of politics.</li>
</ul>
