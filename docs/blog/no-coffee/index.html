<article>
    <p>For my first two decades of life, I could never sleep. I’d go to bed at whatever time was my bedtime (maybe 9pm?) and lay restlessly in the dark for several hours every night until I finally got to sleep. I honestly had no idea that other people <em>didn’t</em> do that, that they got to sleep in an average of twenty minutes. I attribute a lot of my current mental acuity to this — that I had three hours of dedicated and mandatory <em>thinking time</em> every day for twenty years.</p>
<p>In retrospect, probably it was that can of Coke I habitually drank every dinner. It never felt like the caffeine affected me. Those endless nights of sleeplessness just felt like <em>the way it was.</em></p>
<p>I was reminded of this anecdote by a scary experience I had today. I ran into a guy who might have been my old coworker from halfway around the world, many years ago. We never worked together, but he had a distinctive face, and this guy had the same distinctive face.</p>
<p>He might have been my old coworker, but I’m not sure. I didn’t ask. Instead I got <em>the fear.</em> I got so fucking nervous about saying hi to this guy that I flinched away from the encounter, and am left to wonder about his identity forever. Or at least until tomorrow when I’ll probably run into him again at the same place.</p>
<p>These bouts of nerves — I used to get them all the time. But haven’t for the last four months or so. And my last four months have been overwhelmingly socially successful, most of which I attribute to higher-than-usual confidence. It’s the same nerves I used to associate with going over and talking to pretty girls. It’s the same nerves that I got before asking for a raise. It’s the same nerves I got while waiting in the queue at the bank.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Waiting at the bank? How is that nerve-racking? Good question. I’m not sure, but that was the first time I ever associated <em>my nervousness</em> with <em>all the damn caffeine I was drinking.</em> Not that I ever let that stop me from drinking coffee, but at least I was aware of it.</p>
<p>Today, nerves again, for the first time in months. And maybe it’s a coincidence, but I had just finished a strong coffee, after only eating soup for breakfast, after spending four months on an island with notoriously bad coffee, where the instant-variety is ubiquitous. I hadn’t stopped drinking coffee over the last few months, but maybe I’d accidentally stopped overdosing on caffeine?</p>
<p>I’ve been really grooving on being not-unbearably-nervous Sandy these last few months. It’s been a period of aggressive self-actualization; getting to a point where not only do I know I can take on the world, but I <em>feel it,</em> too. How silly would it be if my amazing change in personality was due to a fluke accident of stopping my socially-acceptable drug habit?</p>
<p>Now, granted, this is all conjecture, but it seems worth an experiment. So for the next two weeks, I’m going to consume zero caffeine, and see if I get any more of these nerves. I’ll keep track of my subjective confidence levels, and of my feelings of self-actualization.</p>
<p>On first glance, it feels like my productivity is going to suffer. “Of course caffeine makes me more productive!” Well known fact, that. <em>Everyone knows</em> caffeine makes you more productive. But I can think of more times I’ve been <em>way too caffeinated</em> and completely unable to work, than I can think of times I felt a profound performance improvement from taking a coffee (hangovers excluded.)</p>
<p>Last year I read a book on quitting smoking, even though I don’t and have never smoked. It made the interesting claim that over time, smoking lowers your default state, and having a cigarette brings you back to your old norm. The contrast is there; smoking does make you feel better and more productive, but only relative to your state of withdrawal. Relative to your non-smoking normal, it just brings you back to par. This feels very plausible for the case of coffee as well; I’ve heard much of the same comments from my friends who have stopped drinking it.</p>
<p>The great part is that I already have the infrastructure in place to measure my productivity. A little known secret of this website is that it <a href="https://sandymaguire.me/dailystats/">tracks my computer time <em>to the minute.</em></a> Which means that I have historical productivity data for the last few years, and so looking at trends during the next two weeks requires no extra effort on my part.</p>
<p>I’m writing this blog post mostly because I couldn’t sleep (related????) and figured I might as well do something productive instead of being uncomfortable in bed. I guess the takeaway here is to build lots of weird infrastructure just because it’s interesting. I never expected my daily tracking stuff to be <em>useful,</em> but having already done the legwork means that I’m now ready to carry out an <a href="https://sandymaguire.me/blog/time-compression/">exceptionally high value-of-information</a> experiment.</p>
<p>Oh, and also a reminder that our bodies are just meat machines that respond to chemical inputs just like any other automation does. This is a thing that I always seem to forget, and am constantly amazed when I remember it. Maybe writing it down will help. Hopefully.</p>
<p>You guys! We’re just <em>meat machines!</em> Maybe changing our personalities isn’t as easy as just drinking less coffee, but then again, <em>maybe it is.</em></p>
