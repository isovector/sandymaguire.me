<article>
    <p>I'm not much of a reddit guy, but I just found a neat one: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/">r/theydidthemath</a>. Here's the gist: people ask silly questions, and other people looking to do some mathematical recreation answer their silly questions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theydidthemath/comments/3gsos3/request_if_you_took_the_net_worth_of_taylor_swift/">Here's one</a> that tickled my fancy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you took the net worth of Taylor Swift, in $20 bills, and used those as building blocks, how big of an enclosure could you build around her and still have it remain soundproof?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great question. Let's see if we can figure it out.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=net%20worth%20of%20taylor%20swift">quick google search</a> indicates that Taylor Swift's net worth is $240 million USD. WolframAlpha, the source of all sorts of fantastic and weird mathematical facts, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=volume+of+a+%2420+USD+bill">states</a> the volume of a $20 USD bill is $1138 \text{mm}^3$, which gives us an easy $2.4\cdot 10^8 \text{USD} \div 20 \times 1138 \text{mm}^3\text{/ USD} = 136.5 \text{m}^3$ of building material to work with[^1].</p>
<p>Good start.</p>
<p>We will assume an enclosure around Taylor Swift is a hemisphere shell, and for good measure, we'll pad the floor of the enclosure as well. The volume of a hemisphere is</p>
<p>$$ v = \frac{4 \pi \left(r_o^3 - r_i^3\right)}{6} $$</p>
<p>where $r_o$ and $r_i$ are the outer and inner radii of the sphere, respectively. Since sound attenuates over distance, it would be more helpful to describe $r_i$ as the attenuation distance (which is to say, the necessary thickness of our shell). We rewrite the hemisphere's volume as:</p>
<p>$$ v = \frac{4 \pi \left(r^3 - (r-s)^3\right)}{6} $$</p>
<p>where $s$ is now the shell thickness, and $r$ is the outer radius.</p>
<p>We now need to add the floor of the enclosure, and since hemispherical shells with a floor aren't very popular, we'll need to do the mathematics ourselves. We can model the floor as a bunch of infinitesimally thin of cylinders of varying radii:[^2]</p>
<p>Let $l$ be the total height of the stacked cylinders, and thus volume of our floor's enclosure is:</p>
<p>$$ \int_0^s \pi \left((r-s) \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{l}{r-s}\right)^2}\right)^2 dl = \frac{1}{3} \pi s \left(3r^2 - 6rs + 2s^2\right) $$</p>
<p>Add this to our hemisphere, and the total volume of our enclosure, after simplifying, is thus:</p>
<p>$$ v = \frac{1}{3} \pi s \left(2s - 3r\right)^2 $$</p>
<p>Onwards. I don't know much about sound attenuation, but according to <a href="https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Ultrasonics/Physics/attenuation.htm">this page</a>, sound dissipates according to the law:</p>
<p>$$ A = A_0 e^{-\alpha x} $$</p>
<p>where $A_0$ is the initial loudness, $A$ is the resulting loudness, $\alpha$ is the attenuation coefficient of the material, and $x$ is the distance the sound travels through the material.</p>
<p>The initial question doesn't state if we're trying to sound-proof Taylor Swift or <em>a Taylor Swift concert</em>, so let's try doing both. We assume Taylor will be shouting, so <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/voice-level-d_938.html">we'll aim to sound-proof her up to</a> $A_0 = 78 \text{dB}$ A rock (we're being generous, here) <a href="http://www.gcaudio.com/resources/howtos/loudness.html">concert is approximately</a> $A_0 = 115 \text{dB}$. We assume dampening the sound down to the loudness of a whisper is acceptable, so this gives us $A = 30 \text{dB}$.</p>
<p>Solving our attenuation for $x$ (which is $s$, the necessary width of our shell to achieve sound dampening), we get:</p>
<p>$$ s = \frac{\ln{A_0}-\ln{A}}{\alpha} $$</p>
<p>Great! So given $\alpha$, we should be able to compute $s$. Strangely, there doesn't seem to be much in the literature for the sound attenuation coefficient for paper, so we'll have to use an educated guess here. <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/accoustic-sound-absorption-d_68.html">This page</a> gives coefficients for a few common engineering materials, the closest to paper of which is probably cork.</p>
<p>If you were going to <em>actually build</em> this enclosure around poor Taylor, you would probably want to experimentally find a value for this (and have some <em>really</em> good lawyers), but we'll assume cork is close enough to paper to continue our analysis.</p>
<p>Substituting in $\alpha = 0.15$, the mean coefficient listed for cork, we get:</p>
<p>$$ s_t = \frac{\ln{78}-\ln{30}}{0.15} = 6.4 \text{m} \\ s_c = \frac{\ln{115}-\ln{30}}{0.15} = 9.0 \text{m} \\ $$</p>
<p>where $s_t$ is the necessary shell width to silence Taylor Swift, and $s_c$, to silence her concert.</p>
<p>Because doing math is hard, we'll use WolframAlpha <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+%28136.5+%3D+1%2F3+pi+s+%282+s-3+r%29%5E2+with+s+%3D+6.4%29+for+r">to do the remaining calculations for us</a>:</p>
<p>...which gives us radii smaller than the necessary shell width for the speaking case. Since this is physically impossible, we conclude that such an enclosure can't actually be constructed. Shame.</p>
<p><strong>But wait!</strong> We totally fudged that $\alpha = 0.15$ number for cork. But maybe paper attenuates more like snow? Maybe not, but hey, we've got nothing to work with otherwise. We recompute $s_t$, $s_c$:</p>
<p>$$ s_t = \frac{\ln{78}-\ln{30}}{0.75} = 1.3 \text{m} \\ s_c = \frac{\ln{115}-\ln{30}}{0.75} = 1.8 \text{m} \\ $$</p>
<p>and again run them through WolframAlpha. This time things look better, we get:</p>
<p>$$ r_t = 4.2 \text{m} \\ r_c = 4.0 \text{m} $$</p>
<p>Success! If you want to silence just Taylor Swift, your enclosure can be $4.2 \text{m}$ in radius, and to silence her concert, you lose less than a meter in total radius. Which is super cool, and actually pretty surprising. So, if paper attenuates like snow, you <em>can</em> enclose Taylor Swift in her own money and have her play a concert that no one will ever hear.</p>
<p>Marvelous.</p>
