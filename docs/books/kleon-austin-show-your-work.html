    <p>Amateurs are not afraid to make mistakes or look ridiculous in public.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than the master can,” wrote author C. S. Lewis. “The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten.”</p>

    <p>When Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke was asked what he thought his greatest strength was, he answered, “That I don’t know what I’m doing.” Like one of his heroes, Tom Waits, whenever Yorke feels like his songwriting is getting too comfortable or stale, he’ll pick up an instrument he doesn’t know how to play and try to write with it.</p>

    <p>“Find your voice, shout it from the rooftops, and keep doing it until the people that are looking for you find you.” — Dan Harmon</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.” —Steve Jobs</p>

    <p>Obituaries are like near-death experiences for cowards.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It’s for this reason that I read the obituaries every morning.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Once a day, after you’ve done your day’s work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece of your process that you can share. Where you are in your process will determine what that piece is. If you’re in the very early stages, share your influences and what’s inspiring you. If you’re in the middle of executing a project, write about your methods or share works in progress. If you’ve just completed a project, show the final product, share scraps from the cutting-room floor, or write about what you learned.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The save as draft button is like a prophylactic—it might not feel as good in the moment, but you’ll be glad you used it in the morning.</p>

    <p>make sharing part of your daily routine,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>a lot of the ideas in this book started out as tweets, which then became blog posts, which then became book chapters. Small things, over time, can get big.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Don’t think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Patti Smith got this advice from William Burroughs: “Build a good name. Keep your name clean. Don’t make compromises. Don’t worry about making a bunch of money or being successful. Be concerned with doing good work . . . and if you can build a good name, eventually that name will be its own currency.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Another form of attribution that we often neglect is where we found the work that we’re sharing. It’s always good practice to give a shout-out to the people who’ve helped you stumble onto good work and also leave a bread-crumb trail that people you’re sharing with can follow back to the sources of your inspiration.</p>

    <p>George Orwell wrote: “Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Christopher Hitchens said that the great thing about putting out a book is that “it brings you into contact with people whose opinions you should have canvassed before you ever pressed pen to paper. They write to you. They telephone you. They come to your bookstore events and give you things to read that you should have read already.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>As you put yourself and your work out there, you will run into your fellow knuckleballers. These are your real peers—the people who share your obsessions, the people who share a similar mission to your own, the people with whom you share a mutual respect. There will only be a handful or so of them, but they’re so, so important. Do what you can to nurture your relationships with these people. Sing their praises to the universe. Invite them to collaborate. Show them work before you show anybody else. Call them on the phone and share your secrets. Keep them as close as you can.</p>

    <p>Colin Marshall says: “Compulsive avoidance of embarrassment is a form of suicide.” If you spend your life avoiding vulnerability, you and your work will never truly connect with other people.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“The trick is not caring what EVERYBODY thinks of you and just caring about what the RIGHT people think of you.” —Brian Michael Bendis</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I have been on the Internet a long time. I get a lot of emails from people who are, as far as I can tell, sad, awful, or completely insane.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“We don’t make movies to make money, we make money to make more movies.” —Walt Disney</p>

    <p>Try new things. If an opportunity comes along that will allow you to do more of the kind of work you want to do, say Yes. If an opportunity comes along that would mean more money, but</p>

    <p>Try new things. If an opportunity comes along that will allow you to do more of the kind of work you want to do, say Yes. If an opportunity comes along that would mean more money, but less of the kind of work you want to do, say No.</p>

    <p>“Above all, recognize that if you have had success, you have also had luck—and with luck comes obligation. You owe a debt, and not just to your gods. You owe a debt to the unlucky.” —Michael Lewis</p>

    <p>Ernest Hemingway would stop in the middle of a sentence at the end of his day’s work so he knew where to start in the morning.</p>

    <p>Joni Mitchell says that whatever she feels is the weak link in her last project gives her inspiration for the next.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“Anyone who isn’t embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn’t learning enough,” writes author Alain de Botton.</p>
