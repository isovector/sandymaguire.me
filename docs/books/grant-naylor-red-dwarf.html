    <p>Tipp-Ex. Lister gazed out onto the busy Mimian street</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Is it possible to get a transfer to another shift, sir?&#39; &#39;Why?&#39; Well, with respect, sir, I think you&#39;re mentally unstable. Sit down.&#39; Rimmer shook his head. &#39;There&#39;s always one, isn&#39;t there? One wag. One clown. One imbecile.&#39; &#39;Yes, sir,&#39; Lister agreed, &#39;but he&#39;s not usually in charge, sir.&#39;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>&#39;You&#39;re telling me they haven&#39;t installed an oxygen atmosphere yet?&#39; &#39;No. I&#39;ll have to wander around my house in a spacesuit. But that&#39;s why it&#39;s so cheap!&#39; He quickly downed two pints. &#39;You ought to move there. There&#39;s a plot of about two thousand miles right next door to me. I&#39;m telling you - it&#39;s a great investment. Ten, twelve years, they have plans to install oxygen. Can you imagine what will happen to house prices once the atmosphere&#39;s breathable? They&#39;ll rocket, baby!&#39;</p>

    <p>He would happily have inserted two red hot needles simultaneously through both his ears so they met in the middle of his brain, and tap-danced the title song from 42nd Street barefoot on a bed of molten lava while giving oral sex to a male orangu-tan with dubious personal hygiene, if only it meant attaining that single, elusive golden bar of an Astronavigation Officer, Fourth Class.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>And then he&#39;d go into his impressions. His best one was of Parkur, the mechanoid aboard the Neutron Star&#39; but none of the girls knew him, so it never went down that well.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Then he&#39;d round off the evening with a selection of hits from The Student Prince. And then they&#39;d play prize bingo. The prize in the prize bingo was always a can of jiffy WindoKleen. Nobody ever wanted a can of Jiffy WindoKleen, so Kryten always got it back and was able to use it as the next week&#39;s prize.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Years before, when he&#39;d been promoted to Second Technician&#39; he felt he hadn&#39;t succeeded in becoming a Second Technician&#39; rather, he&#39;d failed to become a First Technician.</p>
