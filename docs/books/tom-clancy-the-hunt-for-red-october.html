    <p>“You are never satisfied, Comrade Captain. I suppose it is men like you who force progress upon us all.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>men who cursed the inability of their country to build submarines worthy of their skills;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In the Soviet Navy there were three routes to advancement. A man could become a zampolit and be a pariah among his peers. Or he could be a navigation officer and advance to his own command. Or he could be shunted into a specialty in which he would gain rank and pay—but never command. Thus a chief engineer on a Soviet naval vessel could outrank his commanding officer and still be his subordinate.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Melekhin, the chief engineer and Ramius’ equal in rank, had never been allowed the route to command simply because his superiors wanted him to be an engineer.</p>

    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Ryan had not been part of this scheme, but presidents have been known to spoil many carefully laid plans.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>reactor spaces, a hospital operating room was a den of libertines.</p>

    <p>“Yes, sir.” It never hurt to call officers sir, Jones knew. Especially the dumb ones.</p>
