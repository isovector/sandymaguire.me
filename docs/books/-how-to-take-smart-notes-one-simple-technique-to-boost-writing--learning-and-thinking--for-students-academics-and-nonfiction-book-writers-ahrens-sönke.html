    <p>Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Very few people struggle with their papers because they don’t know how to cite correctly or because they suffer from a psychological issue that keeps them from writing.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>And if you are a student seeking help with your writing, the chances are that you already aim high too, because it is usually the best students who struggle the most. Good students wrestle with their sentences because they care about finding the right expression. It takes them longer to find a good idea to write about because they know from experience that the first idea is rarely that great and good questions do not fall into their laps. They spend more time in the library to get a better overview of the literature, which leads to more reading, which means that they have to juggle more information.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet. This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>This book is for you, the good students, ambitious academics and curious nonfiction writers who understand that insight doesn’t come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Another item of good news regards the amount of time and effort
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>We usually start with rather vague ideas that are bound to change until they become clearer in the course of our research
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>While some career-oriented academics try to squeeze as many publications out of one idea as possible, Luhmann seemed to do the opposite. He constantly generated more ideas than he was able to write down. His texts read as if he is trying to squeeze as much insight and as many ideas as possible into one publication.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>he seemed to achieve all this with almost no real effort. He not only stressed that he never forced himself to do something he didn’t feel like, he even said: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.”
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box. He kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet, but would sometimes add another note to extend a thought.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another. It was very much like a translation where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the original meaning as truthfully as possible.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Writing that an author struggles in one chapter to justify his method can be a much more adequate description of this chapter’s content than any quote from the text itself
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. The numbers bore no meaning and were only there to identify each note permanently.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If the existing note had the number 22, the new note would become note number 23. If 23 already existed, he named the new note 22a. By alternating numbers and letters, with some slashes and commas in between, he was able to branch out into as many strings of thought as he liked.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Everybody is motivated when the finish line is within reach.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Granted, writing these notes is the main work. It will take enormous amounts of effort, time, patience and willpower, and you will probably break under the weight of this task. Just kidding. It is the easiest part of all. Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The notes are just the tangible outcome of it.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible,” neuroscientist Neil Levy concludes
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters. Don’t cling to an idea if another, more promising one gains momentum.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I strongly recommend using a free program like Zotero, which allows you to make new entries via browser plugins or just by entering the ISBN or digital object identifier (DOI) number.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I strongly recommend using Daniel Lüdecke’s Zettelkasten. It is the only program I know that really implements the principles behind Luhmann’s system and is at the same time simple and easy to use.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>no editor can improve an argument.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Wilhelm von Humboldt, founder of the Humboldt University of Berlin and brother to the great explorer Alexander von Humboldt, put it, the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>You quickly learn to distinguish good-sounding arguments from actual good ones, as you will have to think them through whenever you try to write them down and connect them with your previous knowledge.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The first system is designed to find things you deliberately search for, putting all the responsibility on your brain. The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument. These kinds of notes are just reminders of a thought, which you haven’t had the time to elaborate on yet. Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. In the first case, you forgot what it was supposed to remind you of. In the second case, you forgot the context that gave it its meaning.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>To be able to decide on a topic, one must already have read quite a bit and certainly not just about one topic.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>By focusing on what is interesting and keeping written track of your own intellectual development, topics, questions and arguments will emerge from the material without force.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If we look into our slip-box to see where clusters have built up, we not only see possible topics, but topics we have already worked on – even if we were not able to see it up front.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The promotion of brainstorming as a starting point is all the more surprising as it is not the origin of most ideas: The things you are supposed to find in your head by brainstorming usually don’t have their origins in there. Rather, they come from the outside: through reading, having discussions and listening to others, through all the things that could have been accompanied and often even would have been improved by writing.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards (like doing something nice after finishing a chapter) are only short-term solutions with no prospect of establishing a positive feedback loop. These are very fragile motivational constructions. Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you choose a topic for your paper and work according to the linear model, you will only learn if your choice was wise after multiple stages of research. The same applies to the question of if you understood what you read and if your idea for an argument makes sense.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>When I point out problems within the argument, an ill-defined term or just an ambiguous passage, students usually refer to what they mean first and only shift their focus to what they have written when they fully understand that what they mean is completely irrelevant within the scientific community.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Outlining or changing the outline is also a very different task that requires a very different focus on something else: not on one thought, but on the whole argument. It is important, though, to understand outlining not as the preparation of writing or even as planning, but as a separate task we need to return to throughout the writing process on a regular basis.

    <p>In an experiment, beginner and expert paramedics and their teachers were shown scenes of CPR performed by either experienced paramedics or those who had just finished their training (Flyvbjerg 2001).[19] As you might expect, the experienced paramedics were able to spot their kind correctly in almost all cases (~90%), while the beginners were more or less just guessing (~50%). So far, so good. But when the teachers watched the videos, they systematically mistook the beginners for experts and the experts for beginners. They were wrong in most of the

So far, so good. But when the teachers watched the videos, they systematically mistook the beginners for experts and the experts for beginners. They were wrong in most of the cases (and only right in about a third of all the cases).
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Drawing from the slip-box to develop a draft is more like a dialogue with it than a mechanical act.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Charles Darwin. He forced himself to write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the most critical of his theories. “I had [...] during many years followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favorable ones.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In fact, it is almost impossible to write anything interesting and worth publishing (and therefore motivating) if it is based on nothing else than an idea we were able to come up with up front before elaborating on the problem.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Physicist and Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman once said that he could only determine whether he understood something if he could give an introductory lecture on it.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>While it is obvious that familiarity is not understanding, we have no chance of knowing whether we understand something or just believe we understand something until we test ourselves in some form.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A coach is not there to do the work, but to show us how to use our time and effort in the most effective way.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The objection that it takes too much time to take notes and sort them into the slip-box is therefore short-sighted. Writing, taking notes and thinking about how ideas connect is exactly the kind of elaboration that is needed to learn. Not learning from what we read because we don’t take the time to elaborate on it is the real waste of time.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and frees it up to be creative.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Focusing exclusively on the index would basically mean that we always know upfront what we are looking for
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The consideration of how to structure a topic, therefore, belongs on notes as well – and not on a meta-hierarchical level. We can provide ourselves with a (temporarily valid) overview over a topic or subtopic just by making another note. If we then link from the index to such a note, we have a good entry point. If the overview on this note ceases to correctly represent the state of a cluster or topic, or we decide it should be structured differently, we can write a new note with a better structure and update the respective link from the index.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Every consideration on the structure of a topic is just another consideration on a note – bound to change and dependent on the development of our understanding.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>making good cross-references is a matter of serious thinking and a crucial part of the development of thoughts.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>What we think is relevant for a topic and what is not depends on our current understanding and should be taken quite seriously: It defines an idea as much as the facts it is based on.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>you can collect links to other relevant notes to this topic or question, preferably with a short indication of what to find on these notes (one or two words or a short sentence is sufficient). This kind of note helps to structure thoughts and can be seen as an in-between step towards the development of a manuscript. Above all, they help orientate oneself within the slip-box.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>These note-to-note links are like the “weak links” (Granovetter 1973) of social relationships we have with acquaintances: even though they are usually not the ones we turn to first, they often can offer new and different perspectives.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It is important to always keep in mind that making these links is not a chore, a kind of file-box maintenance. The search for meaningful connections is a crucial part of the thinking process towards the finished manuscript.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The slip-box is like a well-informed but down-to-earth communication partner who keeps us grounded. If we try to feed it some lofty ideas, it will force us to check first: What is the reference? How does that connect to the facts and the ideas you already have?
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you use the slip-box for a while, you will inevitably make a sobering discovery: The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns out to be already in there.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The constant comparing of notes also serves as an ongoing examination of old notes in a new light. I am surprised how often the addition of one note leads to a correction, a complementation or an improvement of old ideas.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>it makes sense to assemble a toolbox of useful mental models (Manktelow and Craik 2004)
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He advocates looking out for the most powerful concepts in every discipline and to try to understand them so thoroughly that they become part of our thinking. The moment one starts to combine these mental models and attach one’s experiences to them, one cannot help but gain what he calls “worldly wisdom.”
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes. This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. It is much better to learn from the experiences of others – especially when this experience is reflected on and turned into versatile “mental models” that can be used in different situations.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The more we know, the more information (hooks) we have to connect new information to, the easier we can form long-term memories. […] Learning becomes fun.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the reason why Watson and Crick or Kekulé had these insights and not a random person on the street is that they already had spent a very long time thinking hard about the problems, tinkered with other possible solutions and tried countless other ways of looking at the problem.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Studies on creativity with engineers show that the ability to find not only creative, but functional and working solutions for technical problems is equal to the ability to make abstractions. The better an engineer is at abstracting from a specific problem, the better and more pragmatic his solutions will be – even for the very problem he abstracted from (Gassmann and Zeschky, 2008, 103).
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits. The RAF forgot to take into account what was not there to see: All the planes that didn’t make it back.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A good rule of thumb for working with the program is: Each note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>We don’t need to worry about the question of what to write about because we have answered the question already – many times on a daily basis.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The truth is that few questions are suitable to be answered within an article, a thesis or a book. Some are too broad, some are too narrow, some are impossible to answer with knowledge we can reasonably acquire, but for most, we just don’t have the material to work with.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If we accompany every step of our work with the question, “What is interesting about this?” and everything we read with the question, “What is so relevant about this that it is worth noting down?” we do not just choose information according to our interest. By elaborating on what we encounter, we also discover aspects we didn’t know anything about before and therefore develop our interests along the way.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>As soon as the structure not longer changes much, we can happily call it a “table of contents.” But even then, it helps to see it as a structural guideline and not a prescription. It is not unusual to change the order of chapters at the very end.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Try working on different manuscripts at the same time. While the slip-box is already helpful to get one project done, its real strength comes into play when we start working on multiple projects at the same time.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“When I am stuck for one moment, I leave it and do something else.” When he was asked what else he did when he was stuck, his answer was: “Well, writing other books. I always work on different manuscripts at the same time. With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.”
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>One of the most difficult tasks is to rigorously delete what has no function within an argument – “kill your darlings.”[42] This becomes much easier when you move the questionable passages into another document and tell yourself you might use them later.
