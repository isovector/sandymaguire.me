    <p>Knowing the design patterns in this book makes it easier to understand existing systems. Most large object-oriented systems use these design patterns. People learning object-oriented programming often complain that the systems they’re working with use inheritance in convoluted ways and that it’s difficult to follow the flow of control. In large part this is because they do not understand the design patterns in the system. Learning these design patterns will help you understand existing object-oriented systems.

    <p>noticing that something is a pattern is the easy part. All four of us are actively working on building object-oriented systems, and we’ve found that it’s easy to spot patterns when you look at enough systems. But finding patterns is much easier than describing them.
If you build systems and then reflect on what you build, you will see patterns in what you do. But it’s hard to describe patterns so that people who don’t know them will understand them and realize why they are important.

    <p>Since one of the main purposes of the book was to teach object-oriented design to new designers, we knew we had to improve the catalog. We expanded the average size of a pattern from less than 2 to more than 10 pages by including a detailed motivating example and sample code. We also started examining the trade-offs and the various ways of implementing the pattern. This made the patterns easier to learn.

    <p>Another important change over the past year has been a greater emphasis on the problem that a pattern solves. It’s easiest to see a pattern as a solution, as a technique that can be adapted and reused. It’s harder to see when it is appropriate—to characterize the problems it solves and the context in which it’s the best solution. In general, it’s easier to see what someone is doing than to know why, and the “why” for a pattern is the problem it solves.

    <p>The Alexandrian point of view has helped us focus on design trade-offs—the different “forces” that help shape a design. His influence made us work harder to understand the applicability and consequences of our patterns. It also kept us from worrying about defining a formal representation of patterns. Although such a representation might make automating patterns possible, at this stage it’s more important to explore the space of design patterns than to formalize it

    <p>James Coplien’s Advanced C++: Programming Styles and Idioms [Cop92] has influenced us, too. The patterns in his book tend to be more C++-specific than our design patterns, and his book contains lots of lower-level patterns as well. But there is some overlap, as we point out in our patterns.
