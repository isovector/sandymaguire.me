    <p>“No, they didn’t,” Tom told him, “on account of this fence, and the cops on duty here, and the state law they passed to make this reservoir off limits to everybody.” “But that was a long time ago,” Dortmunder objected. “Those chemicals are gone. The people that had them took them all themselves.” “Al,” Tom said, “have you ever seen any government give up control, once they got it? Here’s the fence, here’s the cops, here’s the state law says everybody keep out, here’s the job to be done. So they do it. Otherwise, they wouldn’t feel right taking their paycheck every week.”</p>

    <p>“I’m beginning to see,” Dortmunder said. “This is a machine that doesn’t know anything until I tell it something, and if I tell it wrong it believes me.” “That’s about it, yes,” Kelp agreed. “So this machine of yours,” Dortmunder said, “needs me a lot more than I need it.”</p>
