    <p>Although learning from past accidents is still an important part of safety engineering, lessons learned over centuries about designing to prevent accidents may be lost or become ineffective when older technologies are replaced with new ones.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The operation of some systems is so complex that it defies the understanding of all but a few experts, and sometimes even they have incomplete information about the system&#39;s potential behavior. The problem is that we are attempting to build systems that are beyond our ability to intellectually manage;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Inadequate communication between humans and machines is becoming an increasingly important factor in accidents. Current approaches to safety engineering are unable to deal with these new types of errors.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Paradigm changes necessarily start with questioning the basic assumptions underlying what we do today.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Component failure accidents have received the most attention in engineering, but component interaction accidents are becoming more common as the complexity of our system designs increases.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Prevention required identifying and eliminating or mitigating unsafe interactions among the system components. High component reliability does not prevent component interaction accidents.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Reliability is often quantified as mean time between failure. Every hardware component (and most humans) can be made to &quot;break&quot; or fail given some set of conditions or a long enough time.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>At the beginning, the focus in industrial accident prevention was on unsafe conditions, such as open blades and unprotected belts. While this emphasis on preventing unsafe conditions was very successful in reducing workplace injuries, the decrease naturally started to slow down as the most obvious hazards were eliminated. The emphasis then shifted to unsafe acts: Accidents began to be regarded as someone&#39;s fault rather than as an event that could have been prevented by some change in the plant or product.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The backward chaining may also stop because the causal path disappears due to lack of information. Rasmussen suggests that a practical explanation for why actions by operators actively involved in the dynamic flow of events are so often identified as the cause of an accident is the difficulty in continuing the backtracking &quot;through&quot; a human</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>why a &quot;root cause&quot; may be selected is that it is politically acceptable as the identified cause. Other events or explanations may be excluded or not examined in depth because they raise issues that are embarrassing to the organization or its contractors or are politically unacceptable.</p>

    <p>One of the factors involved in the accident was the design of the flight control computer software. Previous incidents with the same type of aircraft had led to a Service Bulletin being issued for a modification of the two flight control computers to fix the problem. But because the computer problem had not been labeled a &quot;cause&quot; of the previous incidents (for perhaps at least partially political reasons), the modification was labeled recommended rather than mandatory. China Airlines concluded, as a result, that the implementation of the changes to the computers was not urgent and decided to delay modification until the next time the flight computers on the plane needed repair [4]. Because of that delay, 264 passengers and crew died.</p>

    <p>It is not uncommon for a company to turn off passive safety devices, such as refrigeration units, to save money. The operating manual specified that the refrigeration unit must be operating whenever MIC was in the system: The chemical has to be maintained at a temperature no higher than 5° Celsius to avoid uncontrolled reactions. A high temperature alarm was to sound if the MIC reached 11°. The refrigeration unit was turned off, however, to save money, and the MIC was usually stored at nearly 20°. The plant management adjusted the threshold of the alarm, accordingly, from 11° to 20° and logging of tank temperatures was halted, thus eliminating the possibility of an early warning of rising temperatures.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>As the plant lost money, many of the skilled workers left for more secure jobs. They either were not replaced or were replaced by unskilled workers.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In the Bhopal accident, the vent scrubber, flare tower, water spouts, refrigeration unit, and various monitoring instruments were all out of operation simultaneously. Assigning probabilities to all these seemingly unrelated events and assuming independence would lead one to believe that this accident was merely a matter of a once-in-a-lifetime coincidence. A probabilistic risk assessment based on an event chain model most likely would have treated these conditions as independent failures and then calculated their coincidence as being so remote as to be beyond consideration. Reason, in his popular Swiss Cheese Model of accident causation based on defense in depth, does the same, arguing that in general &quot;the chances of such a trajectory of opportunity finding loopholes in all the defences at any one time is very small indeed&quot; [172, p. 208]. As suggested earlier, a closer look at Bhopal and, indeed, most accidents paints a quite different picture and shows these were not random failure events but were related to engineering and management decisions stemming from common systemic factors.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Most accidents in well-designed systems involve two or more low-probability events occurring in the worst possible combination.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the Air Force did not take it seriously until they began to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles: there were no pilots to blame for the frequent and devastating explosions of these liquid-propellant missiles. In having to confront factors other than pilot error, the Air Force began to treat safety as a system problem, and System Safety programs were developed to deal with them.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Dekker [51] points out that hindsight allows us to: •Oversimplify causality because we can start from the outcome and reason backward to presumed or plausible &quot;causes.&quot;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>•Overrate the role of rule or procedure &quot;violations.&quot; There is always a gap between written guidance and actual practice, but this gap almost never leads to trouble. It only takes on causal significance once we have a bad outcome to look at and reason about.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>4.Failure of the flightcrew to revert to basic radio navigation at a time when the FMS-assisted navigation became confusing and demanded an excessive workload in a critical phase of the flight.  Look in particular the fourth identified cause: the blame is placed on the pilots when the automation became confusing and demanded an excessive workload rather than on the design of the automation.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The jury concluded that the two companies produced a defective product and that Jeppesen was 17 percent responsible, Honeywell was 8 percent at fault, and American was held to be 75 percent responsible [7]. While such distribution of responsibility may be important in determining how much each company will have to pay, it is arbitrary and does not provide any important information with respect to accident prevention in the future. The verdict is interesting, however, because the jury rejected the oversimplified notion of causality being argued. It was also one of the first cases not settled out of court where the role of software in the loss was acknowledged.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Part of the problem is engineers&#39; tendency to equate people with machines. Human &quot;failure&quot; usually is treated the same as a physical component failure-a deviation from the performance of a specified or prescribed sequence of actions.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>As many human factors experts have found, instructions and written procedures are almost never followed exactly as operators try to become more efficient and productive and to deal with time pressures [167]. In studies of operators, even in such highly constrained and high-risk environments as nuclear power plants, modification of instructions is repeatedly found</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the designer always deals with ideals or averages, not with the actual components themselves. Thus, a designer may have a model of a valve with an average closure time, while real valves have closure times that fall somewhere along a continuum of timing behavior that reflects manufacturing and material differences. The designer&#39;s idealized model is used to develop operator work instructions and training. But the actual system may differ from the designer&#39;s model because of manufacturing and construction variances and evolution and changes over time.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Actions that are quite rational and important during the search for information and test of hypotheses may appear to be unacceptable mistakes in hindsight, without access to the many details of a &quot;turbulent&quot; situation</p>
