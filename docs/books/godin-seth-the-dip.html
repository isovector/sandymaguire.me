    <p>Being the Best in the World Is Seriously Underrated</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>quitting is often a great strategy, a smart way to manage your life and your career. Sometimes, though, quitting is exactly the wrong thing to do. It turns out that there’s a pretty simple way to tell the difference.</p>

    <p>Andy Warhol was the best in the world. So is the Sripraphai Thai restaurant in Queens. So is my editor. So are you, if you want to</p>

    <p>The Dip is the combination of bureaucracy and busywork you must deal with in order to get certified in scuba diving. The Dip is the difference between the easy “beginner” technique and the more useful “expert” approach in skiing or fashion design. The Dip is the long stretch between beginner’s luck and real accomplishment. The Dip is the set of artificial screens set up to keep people like you out.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The Dip creates scarcity; scarcity creates value.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you find yourself facing either of these two curves, you need to quit. Not soon, but right now. The biggest obstacle to success in life, as far as I can tell, is our inability to quit these curves soon enough.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The brave thing to do is to tough it out and end up on the other side—getting all the benefits that come from scarcity. The mature thing is not even to bother starting to snowboard because you’re probably not going to make it through the Dip. And the stupid thing to do is to start, give it your best shot, waste a lot of time and money, and quit right in the middle of the Dip. A few people will choose to do the brave thing and end up the best in the world. Informed people will probably choose to do the mature thing and save their resources for a project they’re truly passionate about. Both are fine choices. It’s the last choice, the common choice, the choice to give it a shot and then quit that you must avoid if you want to succeed.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In a competitive world, adversity is your ally. The harder it gets, the better chance you have of insulating yourself from the competition. If that adversity also causes you to quit, though, it’s all for nothing.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>When Jack Welch remade GE, the most fabled decision he made was this: If we can’t be #1 or #2 in an industry, we must get out.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The next time you’re tempted to vilify a particularly obnoxious customer or agency or search engine, realize that this failed interaction is the best thing that’s happened to you all day long. Without it, you’d be easily replaceable. The Dip is your very best friend.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It’s easier to be mediocre than it is to confront reality and quit.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Before you enter a new market, consider what would happen if you managed to get through the Dip and win in the market you’re already in.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The challenge is simple: Quitting when you hit the Dip is a bad idea. If the journey you started was worth doing, then quitting when you hit the Dip just wastes the time you’ve already invested. Quit in the Dip often enough and you’ll find yourself becoming a serial quitter, starting many things but accomplishing little.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Simple: If you can’t make it through the Dip, don’t start. If you can embrace that simple rule, you’ll be a lot choosier about which journeys you start.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Most of the time, if you fail to become the best in the world, it’s either because you planned wrong or because you gave up before you reached your goal.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The space shuttle is a Cul-de-Sac, not a Dip. When pundits argue in favor of the shuttle, they don’t say, “We should keep doing this because it’s going to get safer/cheaper/more productive over time.” The only reason the shuttle still exists is that no one has the guts to cancel it. There’s no reason to keep investing in something that is not going to get better. In fact, if we canceled the shuttle, we’d create an urgent need for a replacement. The lack of a way to get to space would force us to invent a new, better, cheaper alternative. So why don’t we cancel it? Why not quit? Same reason as always. Because day to day, it’s easier to stick with something that we’re used to, that doesn’t make too many waves, that doesn’t hurt.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The next time you catch yourself being average when you feel like quitting, realize that you have only two good choices: Quit or be exceptional. Average is for losers.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Yes, you should (you must) quit a product or a feature or a design—you need to do it regularly if you’re going to grow and have the resources to invest in the right businesses. But no, you mustn’t quit a market or a strategy or a niche. The businesses we think of as overnight successes weren’t. We just didn’t notice them until they were well baked.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The market wants to see you persist. It demands a signal from you that you’re serious, powerful, accepted, and safe. The bulk of the market, any market, is made up of those folks in the middle of the bell curve, the ones who want to buy something proven and valued.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>When the pain gets so bad that you’re ready to quit, you’ve set yourself up as someone with nothing to lose. And someone with nothing to lose has quite a bit of power. You can go for broke. Challenge authority. Attempt unattempted alternatives. Lean into a problem; lean so far that you might just lean right through it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>When a kid drops out of football or karate, it’s not because she’s carefully considered the long-term consequences of her action. She does it because her coach keeps yelling at her, and it’s not fun. It’s better to stop.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Short-term pain has more impact on most people than long-term benefits do, which is why it’s so important for you to amplify the long-term benefits of not quitting. You need to remind yourself of life at the other end of the Dip because it’s easier to overcome the pain of yet another unsuccessful cold call if the reality of a successful sales career is more concrete.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The time to look for a new job is when you don’t need one. The time to switch jobs is before it feels comfortable. Go. Switch. Challenge yourself; get yourself a raise and a promotion. You owe it to your career and your skills.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If your job is a Cul-de-Sac, you have to quit or accept the fact that your career is over.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>QUESTION 1: AM I PANICKING?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Quitting when you’re panicked is dangerous and expensive. The best quitters, as we’ve seen, are the ones who decide in advance when they’re going to quit. You can always quit later—so wait until you’re done panicking to decide.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you’re trying to influence just one person, persistence has its limits. It’s easy to cross the line between demonstrating your commitment and being a pest. If you haven’t influenced him yet, it may very well be time to quit.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Sergey Brin, cofounder of Google, told me, “We knew that Google was going to get better every single day as we worked on it, and we knew that sooner or later, everyone was going to try it. So our feeling was that the later you tried it, the better it was for us because we’d make a better impression with better technology. So we were never in a big hurry to get you to use it today. Tomorrow would be better.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Here’s an assignment for you: Write it down. Write down under what circumstances you’re willing to quit. And when. And then stick with it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>You’re Astonishing How dare you waste it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try.</p>
