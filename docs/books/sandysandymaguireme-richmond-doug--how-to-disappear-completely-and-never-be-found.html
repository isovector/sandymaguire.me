    <p>A funny thing happens when these dreamers suddenly become planners. They have more or less made the decision to leave and it is like a great weight is lifted from their shoulders. Their work and family life become more bearable. Things seem to be improving for them. But it is only the calm before the storm. One day they wake up and decide that this is going to be the last day, and they walk out the front door into a whole new life they&#39;ve prepared.

    <p>Your friend may help you destroy your old life but doesn&#39;t want to see your scheme destroy his life. And you won&#39;t be there to hold his hand as the police try to coerce your whereabouts out of him.
