    <p>Many young engineers feel that the minor chores of a technical project are beneath their dignity and unworthy of their college training. They expect to prove their true worth in some major, vital enterprise. Actually, the spirit and effectiveness with which you tackle your first humble tasks will very likely be carefully watched and may affect your entire career.

    <p>Develop a &quot;let&#39;s go see!&quot; attitude.
Throughout your career people will approach you with all manner of real-life problems they will have observed on devices or equipment for which you have responsibility. A wonderfully effective response, both technically and administratively, is to invite them to have a look with you — i.e., &quot;Let&#39;s go see!&quot; It is seldom adequate to remain at one&#39;s desk and speculate about causes and solutions, or to retreat to drawings, specifications, and reports and hope to sort it all out. Before ever being able to solve a problem, you will need abundant insight, insight that can only be developed by observing first-hand what might be at once too subtle and complex only to imagine (Ferguson, p. 56).

    <p>Many novices hesitate to bother their superiors with everyday minutiae, and it is certainly true that it can be overdone in this direction, but in by far the majority of cases the manager&#39;s problem is to extract enough information to keep adequately posted. It is a much safer course to risk having your supervisor say, &quot;Don&#39;t bother me with so many details,&quot; than to allow your supervisor to say, &quot;Why doesn&#39;t someone tell me these things?&quot;

    <p>There are only two proper alternatives open to you: (1) accept your boss as the representative of a higher authority and execute his or her policies and directives as effectively as possible, or (2) move to some other department, division, or company at the first opportunity. A great deal of mischief can be done to the interests of all concerned, including your company, if some other alternative is elected.

    <p>In general, a program laid down by the department, the project leader, or the design team is a proposal, rather than an edict. It is usually intended to serve only as a guideline, one that will have been formulated without benefit of the new information that will be discovered during its execution. The rule therefore is to keep others, your manager included, informed of what you have done, at reasonable intervals, and ask for approval of any well-considered and properly planned deviations that you may have conceived.
