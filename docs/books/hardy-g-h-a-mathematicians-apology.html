    <p>Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Good work is not done by ‘humble’ men.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A man who is always asking ‘Is what I do worth while?’ and ‘Am I the right person to do it?’ will always be ineffective himself and a discouragement to others.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>unfortunately I have no talent for such pursuits.’ I am not suggesting that this is a defence which can be made by most people, since most people can do nothing at all well.</p>

    <p>I would rather be a novelist or a painter than a statesman of similar rank;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It is usual to exaggerate rather grossly the differences between the mental processes of mathematicians and other people, but it is undeniable that a gift for mathematics is one of the most specialized talents, and that mathematicians as a class are not particularly distinguished for general ability or versatility. If a man is in any sense a real mathematician, then it is a hundred to one that his mathematics will be far better than anything else he can do, and that he would be silly if he surrendered any decent opportunity of exercising his one talent</p>

    <p>It is usual to exaggerate rather grossly the differences between the mental processes of mathematicians and other people, but it is undeniable that a gift for mathematics is one of the most specialized talents, and that mathematicians as a class are not particularly distinguished for general ability or versatility. If a man is in any sense a real mathematician, then it is a hundred to one that his mathematics will be far better than anything else he can do, and that he would be silly if he surrendered any decent opportunity of exercising his one talent in order to do undistinguished work in other fields.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>What we do may be small, but it has a certain character of permanence; and to have produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done something utterly beyond the powers of the vast majority of men.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There are many highly respectable motives which may lead men to prosecute research, but three which are much more important than the rest. The first (without which the rest must come to nothing) is intellectual curiosity, desire to know the truth. Then, professional pride, anxiety to be satisfied with one’s performance, the shame that overcomes any self-respecting craftsman when his work is unworthy of his talent. Finally, ambition, desire for reputation, and the position, even the power or the money, which it brings.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It may be fine to feel, when you have done your work, that you have added to the happiness or alleviated the sufferings of others, but that will not be why you did it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The Greeks were the first mathematicians who are still ‘real’ to us to-day. Oriental mathematics may be an interesting curiosity, but Greek mathematics is the real thing. The Greeks first spoke a language which modern mathematicians can understand;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Greek mathematics is ‘permanent’, more permanent even than Greek literature. Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He would have rejected their careers because of his ambition, because he would have scorned to be a man to be forgotten in twenty years. Yet how painful it is to feel that, with all these advantages, one may fail. I can remember Bertrand Russell telling me of a horrible dream. He was in the top floor of the University Library, about A.D. 2100. A library assistant was going round the shelves carrying an enormous bucket, taking down book after book, glancing at them, restoring them to the shelves or dumping them into the bucket. At last he came to three large volumes which Russell could recognize as the last surviving copy of Principia mathematica. He took down one of the volumes, turned over a few pages, seemed puzzled for a moment by the curious symbolism, closed the volume, balanced it in his hand and hesitated....</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It is sometimes suggested, by lawyers or politicians or business men, that an academic career is one sought mainly by cautious and unambitious persons who care primarily for comfort and security. The reproach is quite misplaced. A don surrenders something, and in particular the chance of making large sums of money—it is very hard for a professor to make £2000 a year; and security of tenure is naturally one of the considerations which make this particular surrender easy. That is not why Housman would have refused to be Lord Simon or Lord Beaverbrook. He would have rejected their careers because of his ambition, because he would have scorned to be a man to be forgotten in twenty years.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A MATHEMATICIAN, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A painter makes patterns with shapes and colours, a poet with words. A painting may embody an ‘idea’, but the idea is usually commonplace and unimportant.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>‘I cannot satisfy myself that there are any such things as poetical ideas.... Poetry is not the thing said but a way of saying it.’</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The poverty of the ideas seems hardly to affect the beauty of the verbal pattern.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Most people have some appreciation of mathematics, just as most people can enjoy a pleasant tune;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>there are probably more people really interested in mathematics than in music. Appearances may suggest the contrary, but there are easy explanations. Music can be used to stimulate mass emotion, while mathematics cannot; and musical incapacity is recognized (no doubt rightly) as mildly discreditable, whereas most people are so frightened of the name of mathematics that they are ready, quite unaffectedly, to exaggerate their own mathematical stupidity.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Yet a chess problem is simply an exercise in pure mathematics (a game not entirely, since psychology also plays a part), and everyone who calls a problem ‘beautiful’ is applauding mathematical beauty, even if it is beauty of a comparatively lowly kind. Chess problems are the hymn-tunes of mathematics.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The ‘seriousness’ of a mathematical theorem lies, not in its practical consequences, which are usually negligible, but in the significance of the mathematical ideas which it connects.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The seriousness of a theorem, of course, does not lie in its consequences, which are merely the evidence for its seriousness.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Shakespeare had an enormous influence on the development of the English language, Otway next to none, but that is not why Shakespeare was the better poet. He was the better poet because he wrote much better poetry. The inferiority of the chess problem, like that of Otway’s poetry,</p>

    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Those which I have given are test cases, and a reader who cannot appreciate them is unlikely to appreciate anything in mathematics.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The number of primes less than 1,000,000,000 is 50,847,478: that is enough for an engineer, and he can be perfectly happy without the rest.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>as regards Pythagoras’s, it is obvious that irrationals are uninteresting to an engineer, since he is concerned only with approximations, and all approximations are rational.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>there is no mathematician so pure that he feels no interest at all in the physical world;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>but sufficient reason that they do not fit the facts. The general conclusion, surely, stands out</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The case for my life, then, or for that of any one else who has been a mathematician in the same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to knowledge, and helped others to add more;</p>
