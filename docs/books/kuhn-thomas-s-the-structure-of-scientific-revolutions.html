    <p>associated with the names of Copernicus, Newton, Lavoisier,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The study of paradigms, including many that are far more specialized than those named illustratively above, is what mainly prepares the student for membership in the particular scientific community with which he will later practice. Because he there joins men who learned the bases of their field from the same concrete models, his subsequent practice will seldom evoke overt disagreement over fundamentals.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>History suggests that the road to a firm research consensus is extraordinarily arduous.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The resulting pool of facts contains those accessible to casual observation and experiment together with some of the more esoteric data retrievable from established crafts like medicine, calendar making, and metallurgy. Because the crafts are one readily accessible source of facts that could not have been casually discovered, technology has often played a vital role in the emergence of new sciences.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“Truth emerges more readily from error than from confusion.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>When the individual scientist can take a paradigm for granted, he need no longer, in his major works, attempt to build his field anew, starting from first principles and justifying the use of each concept introduced. That can be left to the writer of textbooks</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Given a textbook, however, the creative scientist can begin his research where it leaves off and thus concentrate exclusively upon the subtlest and most esoteric aspects of the natural phenomena that concern his group. And as he does this, his research communiqués will begin to change in ways whose evolution has been too little studied but whose modern end products are obvious to all and oppressive to many. No longer will his researches usually be embodied in books addressed, like Franklin’s Experiments . . . on Electricity or Darwin’s Origin of Species, to anyone who might be interested in the subject matter of the field. Instead they will usually appear as brief articles addressed only to professional colleagues, the men whose knowledge of a shared paradigm can be assumed and who prove to be the only ones able to read the papers addressed to them.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Both in mathematics and astronomy, research reports had ceased already in antiquity to be intelligible to a generally educated audience.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Although it has become customary, and is surely proper, to deplore the widening gulf that separates the professional scientist from his colleagues in other fields, too little attention is paid to the essential relationship between that gulf and the mechanisms intrinsic to scientific advance.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Paradigms gain their status because they are more successful than their competitors in solving a few problems that the group of practitioners has come to recognize as acute.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The areas investigated by normal science are, of course, minuscule; the enterprise now under discussion has drastically restricted vision. But those restrictions, born from confidence in a paradigm, turn out to be essential to the development of science.

    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The areas investigated by normal science are, of course, minuscule; the enterprise now under discussion has drastically restricted vision. But those restrictions, born from confidence in a paradigm, turn out to be essential to the development of science. By focusing attention upon a small range of relatively esoteric problems, the paradigm forces scientists to investigate some part of nature in a detail and depth that would otherwise be unimaginable.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Bringing a normal research problem to a conclusion is achieving the anticipated in a new way, and it requires the solution of all sorts of complex instrumental, conceptual, and mathematical puzzles. The man who succeeds proves himself an expert puzzle-solver, and the challenge of the puzzle is an important part of what usually drives him on.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>one of the things a scientific community acquires with a paradigm is a criterion for choosing problems that, while the paradigm is taken for granted, can be assumed to have solutions. To a great extent these are the only problems that the community will admit as scientific or encourage its members to undertake. Other problems, including many that had previously been standard, are rejected as metaphysical, as the concern of another discipline, or sometimes as just too problematic to be worth the time.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>One of the reasons why normal science seems to progress so rapidly is that its practitioners concentrate on problems that only their own lack of ingenuity should keep them from solving.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The scientific enterprise as a whole does from time to time prove useful, open up new territory, display order, and test long-accepted belief. Nevertheless, the individual engaged on a normal research problem is almost never doing any one of these things. Once engaged, his motivation is of a rather different sort. What then challenges him is the conviction that, if only he is skilful enough, he will succeed in solving a puzzle that no one before has solved or solved so well.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If, for example, the student of Newtonian dynamics ever discovers the meaning of terms like ‘force,’ ‘mass,’ ‘space,’ and ‘time,’ he does so less from the incomplete though sometimes helpful definitions in his text than by observing and participating in the application of these concepts to problem-solution.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Discovery is not the sort of process about which the question is appropriately asked.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>As a ruling about priority and date, an answer does not at all concern us. Nevertheless, an attempt to produce one will illuminate the nature of discovery, because there is no answer of the kind that is sought. Discovery is not the sort of process about which the question is appropriately asked.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Though undoubtedly correct, the sentence, “Oxygen was discovered,” misleads by suggesting that discovering something is a single simple act assimilable to our usual (and also questionable) concept of seeing.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In science, as in the playing card experiment, novelty emerges only with difficulty, manifested by resistance, against a background provided by expectation.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>in the sciences fact and theory, discovery and invention, are not categorically and permanently distinct,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Failure of existing rules is the prelude to a search for new ones.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>But as time went on, a man looking at the net result of the normal research effort of many astronomers could observe that astronomy’s complexity was increasing far more rapidly than its accuracy and that a discrepancy corrected in one place was likely to show up in another.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>That proliferation of versions of a theory is a very usual symptom of crisis.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Increasingly, the research it guided resembled that conducted under the competing schools of the pre-paradigm period, another typical effect of crisis.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The novel theory seems a direct response to crisis.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It is often said that if Greek science had been less deductive and less ridden by dogma, heliocentric astronomy might have begun its development eighteen centuries earlier than it did.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>So long as the tools a paradigm supplies continue to prove capable of solving the problems it defines, science moves fastest and penetrates most deeply through confident employment of those tools. The reason is clear. As in manufacture so in science—retooling is an extravagance to be reserved for the occasion that demands it. The</p>

    <p>So long as the tools a paradigm supplies continue to prove capable of solving the problems it defines, science moves fastest and penetrates most deeply through confident employment of those tools. The reason is clear. As in manufacture so in science—retooling is an extravagance to be reserved for the occasion that demands it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The significance of crises is the indication they provide that an occasion for retooling has arrived.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>a scientific theory is declared invalid only if an alternate candidate is available to take its place.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Newton’s second law of motion,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“the essential tension” implicit in scientific research.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>To reject one paradigm without simultaneously substituting another is to reject science itself. That act reflects not on the paradigm but on the man. Inevitably he will be seen by his colleagues as “the carpenter who blames his tools.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>On the contrary, what we previously called the puzzles that constitute normal science exist only because no paradigm that provides a basis for scientific research ever completely resolves all its problems. The very few that have ever seemed to do so (e.g., geometric optics) have shortly ceased to yield research problems at all and have instead become tools for engineering.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>How can the situation have seemed otherwise? That question necessarily leads to the historical and critical elucidation of philosophy, and those topics are here barred.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the generalization that truth and falsity are uniquely and unequivocally determined by the confrontation of statement with fact.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The applications given in texts are not there as evidence but because learning them is part of learning the paradigm at the base of current practice.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Very often scientists are willing to wait, particularly if there are many problems available in other parts of the field.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Wolfgang Pauli, in the months before Heisenberg’s paper on matrix mechanics pointed the way to a new quantum theory, wrote to a friend, “At the moment physics is again terribly confused. In any case, it is too difficult for me, and I wish I had been a movie comedian or something of the sort and had never heard of physics.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>That testimony is particularly impressive if contrasted with Pauli’s words less than five months later: “Heisenberg’s type of mechanics has again given me hope and joy in life. To be sure it does not supply the solution to the riddle, but I believe it is again possible to march forward.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>since no experiment can be conceived without some sort of theory, the scientist in crisis will constantly try to generate speculative theories that, if successful, may disclose the road to a new paradigm and, if unsuccessful, can be surrendered with relative ease.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Scientists have not generally needed or wanted to be philosophers.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Indeed, normal science usually holds creative philosophy at arm’s’length, and probably for good reasons.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>More often no such structure is consciously seen in advance. Instead, the new paradigm, or a sufficient hint to permit later articulation, emerges all at once, sometimes in the middle of the night, in the mind of a man deeply immersed in crisis.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Almost always the men who achieve these fundamental inventions of a new paradigm have been either very young or very new to the field whose paradigm they change.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>obviously these are the men who, being little committed by prior practice to the traditional rules of normal science, are particularly likely to see that those rules no longer define a playable game and to conceive another set that can replace them.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Political revolutions aim to change political institutions in ways that those institutions themselves prohibit. Their success therefore necessitates the partial relinquishment of one set of institutions in favor of another, and in the interim, society is not fully governed by institutions at all.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the view of science-as-cumulation is entangled with a dominant epistemology that takes knowledge to be a construction placed directly upon raw sense data by the mind.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Cumulative acquisition of unanticipated novelties proves to be an almost non-existent exception to the rule of scientific development.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Normal research, which is cumulative, owes its success to the ability of scientists regularly to select problems that can be solved with conceptual and instrumental techniques close to those already in existence.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>an excessive concern with useful problems, regardless of their relation to existing knowledge and technique, can so easily inhibit scientific development.)</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The man who is striving to solve a problem defined by existing knowledge and technique is not, however, just looking around. He knows what he wants to achieve, and he designs his instruments and directs his thoughts accordingly.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Unanticipated novelty, the new discovery, can emerge only to the extent that his anticipations about nature and his instruments prove wrong.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Often the importance of the resulting discovery will itself be proportional to the extent and stubbornness of the anomaly that foreshadowed it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the physical referents of these Einsteinian concepts are by no means identical with those of the Newtonian concepts that bear the same name. (Newtonian mass is conserved; Einsteinian is convertible with energy. Only at low relative velocities may the two be measured in the same way, and even then they must not be conceived to be the same.) Unless we change the definitions of the variables in the N1’s, the statements we have derived are not Newtonian. If we do change them, we cannot properly be said to have derived Newton’s Laws, at least not in any sense of “derive” now generally recognized.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />

    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Gravity, interpreted as an innate attraction between every pair of particles of matter, was an occult quality in the same sense as the scholastics’ “tendency to fall” had been.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>paradigms provide scientists not only with a map but also with some of the directions essential for map-making.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In learning a paradigm the scientist acquires theory, methods, and standards together, usually in an inextricable mixture.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>To the extent, as significant as it is incomplete, that two scientific schools disagree about what is a problem and what a solution, they will inevitably talk through each other when debating the relative merits of their respective paradigms.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It is as elementary prototypes for these transformations of the scientist’s world that the familiar demonstrations of a switch in visual gestalt prove so suggestive. What were ducks in the scientist’s world before the revolution are rabbits afterwards. The man who first saw the exterior of the box from above later sees its interior from below. Transformations like these, though usually more gradual and almost always irreversible, are common concomitants of scientific training.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Looking at a contour map, the student sees lines on paper, the cartographer a picture of a terrain. Looking at a bubble-chamber photograph, the student sees confused and broken lines, the physicist a record of familiar subnuclear events. Only after a number of such transformations of vision does the student become an inhabitant of the scientist’s world, seeing what the scientist sees and responding as the scientist does.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Therefore, at times of revolution, when the normal-scientific tradition changes, the scientist’s perception of his environment must be re-educated—in some familiar situations he must learn to see a new gestalt. After he has done so the world of his research will seem, here and there, incommensurable with the one he had inhabited before.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Literally as well as metaphorically, the man accustomed to inverting lenses has undergone a revolutionary transformation of vision.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The subject of a gestalt demonstration knows that his perception has shifted because he can make it shift back and forth repeatedly while he holds the same book or piece of paper in his hands. Aware that nothing in his environment has changed, he directs his attention increasingly not to the figure (duck or rabbit) but to the lines on the paper he is looking at. Ultimately he may even learn to see those lines without seeing either of the figures, and he may then say (what he could not legitimately have said earlier) that it is these lines that he really sees but that he sees them alternately as a duck and as a rabbit.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Looking at the moon, the convert to Copernicanism does not say, “I used to see a planet, but now I see a satellite.” That locution would imply a sense in which the Ptolemaic system had once been correct. Instead, a convert to the new astronomy says, “I once took the moon to be (or saw the moon as) a planet, but I was mistaken.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Textbooks thus begin by truncating the scientist’s sense of his discipline’s history and then proceed to supply a substitute for what they have eliminated. Characteristically, textbooks of science contain just a bit of history, either in an introductory chapter or, more often, in scattered references to the great heroes of an earlier age. From such references both students and professionals come to feel like participants in a long-standing historical tradition. Yet the textbook-derived tradition in which scientists come to sense their participation is one that, in fact, never existed. For reasons that are both obvious and highly functional, science textbooks (and too many of the older histories of science) refer only to that part of the work of past scientists that can easily be viewed as contributions to the statement and solution of the texts’ paradigm problems.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>But that is not the way a science develops. Many of the puzzles of contemporary normal science did not exist until after the most recent scientific revolution.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the pedagogic arsenal that makes a man a scientist</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The man who embraces a new paradigm at an early stage must often do so in defiance of the evidence provided by problem-solving. He must, that is, have faith that the new paradigm will succeed with the many large problems that confront it, knowing only that the older paradigm has failed with a few. A decision of that kind can only be made on faith. That is one of the reasons why prior crisis proves so important. Scientists who have not experienced it will seldom renounce the hard evidence of problem-solving</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>To a very great extent the term ‘science’ is reserved for fields that do progress in obvious ways.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Does a field make progress because it is a science, or is it a science because it makes progress?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>there are no other professional communities in which individual creative work is so exclusively addressed to and evaluated by other members of the profession.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The most esoteric of poets or the most abstract of theologians is far more concerned than the scientist with lay approbation of his creative work, though he may be even less concerned with approbation in general.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>because he is working only for an audience of colleagues, an audience that shares his own values and beliefs, the scientist can take a single set of standards for granted. He need not worry about what some other group or school will think and can therefore dispose of one problem and get on to the next more quickly than those who work for a more heterodox group. Even more important, the insulation of the scientific community from society permits the individual scientist to concentrate his attention upon problems that he has good reason to believe he will be able to solve.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Unlike the engineer, and many doctors, and most theologians, the scientist need not choose problems because they urgently need solution and without regard for the tools available to solve them.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In these fields the student relies mainly on textbooks until, in his third or fourth year of graduate work, he begins his own research. Many science curricula do not ask even graduate students to read in works not written specially for students. The few that do assign supplementary reading in research papers and monographs restrict such assignments to the most advanced courses and to materials that take up more or less where the available texts leave off. Until the very last stages in the education of a scientist, textbooks are systematically substituted for the creative scientific literature that made them possible. Given the confidence in their paradigms, which makes this educational technique possible, few scientists would wish to change it. Why, after all, should the student of physics, for example, read the works of Newton, Faraday, Einstein, or Schrödinger, when everything he needs to know about these works is recapitulated in a far briefer, more precise, and more systematic form in a number of up-to-date textbooks?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Without wishing to defend the excessive lengths to which this type of education has occasionally been carried, one cannot help but notice that in general it has been immensely effective.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Scientific education makes use of no equivalent for the art museum or the library of classics, and the result is a sometimes drastic distortion in the scientist’s perception of his discipline’s past.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>One of the strongest, if still unwritten, rules of scientific life is the prohibition of appeals to heads of state or to the populace at large in matters scientific.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the unit of scientific achievement is the solved problem and because the group knows well which problems have already been solved,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Novelty for its own sake is not a desideratum in the sciences as it is in so many other creative fields.</p>
