    <p>Pete called Jim Lovell &quot;Shaky,&quot; because it was the last thing a pilot would want to be called.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>in some strange unofficial way, peeking through his fingers, his instructor halfway expected him to challenge all the limits. They would give a lecture about how a pilot should never fly without a good solid breakfast—eggs, bacon, toast, and so forth—because if he tried to fly with his blood-sugar level too low, it could impair his alertness. Naturally, the next day every hot dog in the unit would get up and have a breakfast consisting of one cup of black coffee and take off and go up into a vertical climb until the weight of the ship exactly canceled out the upward thrust of the engine and his air speed was zero, and he would hang there for one thick adrenal instant—and then fall like a rock, until one of three things happened: he keeled over nose first and regained his aerodynamics and all was well, he went into a spin and fought his way out of it, or he went into a spin and had to eject or crunch it, which was always supremely possible.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Once the theorem and the corollary were understood, the Navy&#39;s statistics about one in every four Navy aviators dying meant nothing. The figures were averages, and averages applied to those with average stuff.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>yet once in the air the non-com had his own standards. He was determined to remain as outwardly cool as the pilot, so that when the pilot did something that truly petrified him, he would say nothing; instead, he would turn silent, catatonic, like a zombie. Perfect! Zombie. There you had it, compressed into a single word, all of the foregoing. I&#39;m a hell of a pilot! I shoot dice with death! And now all you fellows know it! And I haven&#39;t spoken of that unspoken stuff even once!</p>
    <hr class="chill" />

    <p>A person had to see it to believe it: flocks of sea gulls wheeling around in the air out in the middle of the high desert in the dead of winter and grazing on antediluvian crustaceans in the primordial ooze.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The attempt to push beyond Mach 1—&quot;breaking the sound barrier&quot;—was set for October 14, 1947. Not being an engineer, Yeager didn&#39;t believe the &quot;barrier&quot; existed.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Yeager didn&#39;t go to Pancho&#39;s and knock back a few because two days later the big test was coming up. Nor did he knock back a few because it was the weekend. No, he knocked back a few because night had come and he was a pilot at Muroc.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In keeping with the military tradition of Flying &amp; Drinking, that was what you did, for no other reason than that the sun had gone down.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>At Edwards you had men like Crossfield, Iven Kincheloe, and Joe Walker, who had already flown rockets many times. So what was the big deal about Sputnik 1? The problem was already on the way to being solved. That was the way it looked to Yeager and to everybody involved in the X series at Edwards. It was hard to realize how Sputnik 1 looked to the rest of the country and particularly to politicians and the press… and other technological illiterates with influence… It was hard to realize that Sputnik 1, if not the MiG-15, would strike terror in the heart of the West.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>announcement calling for volunteers did mention test pilots as being among the types of men who might qualify, but it also mentioned submarine crew members, parachute jumpers, arctic explorers, mountain climbers, deep sea divers, even scuba divers, combat veterans, and, for that matter, mere veterans of combat training, and men who had served as test subjects for acceleration and atmospheric pressure tests, such as the Air Force and Navy had been running. The astronaut would not be expected to do anything; he only had to be able to take it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>and all of them with lean lineless faces and suntans and the unmistakable cocky rolling gait of fighter jocks, not to mention the pathetic-looking civilian suits and the enormous wrist watches. The wristwatches had about two thousand calibrations on them and dials for recording everything short of the sound of enemy guns. These terrific wristwatches were practically fraternal insignia among the pilots. Thirty-odd young souls wearing Robert Hall clothes that cost about a fourth as much as their watches: in the year 1959 this just had to be a bunch of military pilots trying to disguise themselves as civilians.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>They strapped each man into a huge human milkshake apparatus</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the man is sitting across the table from Conrad and gives him the sheet of paper and asks him to study it and tell him what he sees. Conrad stares at the piece of paper and then looks up at the man and says in a wary tone, as if he fears a trick: &quot;But it&#39;s upside down.&quot;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Gus was one of those young men, quite common in the United States, actually, who would fight you down to the last unbroken bone over an insult to the gray little town they came from or the grim little church they fidgeted in all those years—while at the same time, in some hidden corner of the soul, they prostrated themselves daily in thanksgiving to the things that had gotten them the hell out of there.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>But when it becomes the turn of the guy sitting on Gus&#39;s left, John Glenn, the only Marine in the group—it&#39;s hard to believe. This guy starts turning on the charm! He has a regular little speech on the subject. &quot;I don&#39;t think any of us could really go on with something like this,&quot; he says, &quot;if we didn&#39;t have pretty good backing at home, really. My wife&#39;s attitude toward this has been the same as it has been all along through my flying. If it is what I want to do, she is behind it, and the kids are, too, a hundred percent.&quot; What the hell was he talking about? I don&#39;t think any of us could really go on with something like this… What possible difference could a wife&#39;s attitude make about an opportunity for a giant step up the great ziggurat? What was with this guy?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>What can anybody say as a follow-up to this man and his speeches about the Wife and the Children and the Family and Sunday School and God? What can you do, say that as a matter of fact you can get along just as well without any of them as long as they&#39;ll let you fly?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>God… Family… the only thing that Glenn hadn&#39;t wrapped them all up in was Country, and so he took care of that, too.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Grissom&#39;s way of lapsing into impenetrable blank stares, as if some grim wintertime north-country Lutheran cloud of Original Sin were passing in front of his face.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Sometimes they would fly all the way to California and back, and it was likely that if they exchanged a total of forty sentences, transcontinental, they would come back feeling like they&#39;d had a hell of an animated conversation and a deep talk.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>guileless as some thought. From the beginning, in the interview</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Cooper turned out to be neither so naive nor so guileless</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The boys never took to the old swimming hole. They much preferred the swimming pool across the street at the community club. It had a diving board and a concrete apron and clear water and other children to play with. The floating dock remained out back moldering in the lake like a reminder of the kind of fatherhood that the astronaut life began imposing on all seven families.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Naturally, nobody built hotels in Cocoa Beach, only motels; and when they built apartment houses, they built them like motels, so that you could drive up to your own door. At neither the motels nor the apartment houses did you have to go through a public lobby to get to your room. A minor architectural note, one might say—and yet in Cocoa Beach, like so many towns of the new era, this one fact did more than the pill to encourage what would later be rather primly named &quot;the sexual revolution.&quot;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Oh, genius-engineers! Ah, yes, there was such a thing as self-esteem among engineers. It may not have been as grandiose as that of fighter jocks… nevertheless, many was the steaming enchephalitic summertime Saturday night at Langley when some NASA engineer would start knocking back that good sweet Virginia A.B.C. store bourbon on the patio and letting his ego out for a little romp, like a growling red dog.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The astronauts spent so much time hitting the abort handle in the procedures trainer that it got to the point where it seemed as if they were training for an abort rather than for a launch.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A life of avoiding the blue bolts and gratefully accepting the attaboys and pellets had become the better part of valor.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>gone. The Air Force had taken her property by eminent</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He had been through this same sensation many times on the centrifuge. As long as he just took it and didn&#39;t struggle, they wouldn&#39;t zap all those goddamned blue bolts into the soles of his feet. There were a lot worse things in this world than g-forces… He was weightless now, hurtling toward Bermuda, and they flashed the lights in his cubicle, and the ape&#39;s pulse returned to normal, to no more than what it was on the ground. The usual shit was flowing. The main thing was to keep ahead of those blue bolts in the feet!… He started pushing the buttons and throwing the switches like the greatest electric Wurlitzer organist who ever lived, never missed a signal…</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Just twenty days before the first scheduled Mercury flight he sent a five-ton Sputnik called Vostok 1 into orbit around the earth with a man aboard, the first cosmonaut, a twenty-seven-year-old test pilot named Yuri Gagarin.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Given the huge booster rockets at his disposal, he seemed to be able to play these little games with his adversaries at will. There was the eerie feeling that he would continue to let NASA struggle furiously to catch up—and then launch some startling new demonstration of just how far ahead he really was.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Over the three weeks since the great Soviet triumph of Gagarin&#39;s flight, one terrible event had followed another. The United States had sent in a puppet army of Cuban exiles to conquer the Soviets&#39; puppet regime in Cuba, and instead suffered the humiliation that became known as the Bay of Pigs. This had nothing directly to do with the space flight, of course, but it heightened the feeling that this was not the time to be trying brave and desperate deeds in the contest with the Soviets. The sad truth was, our boys always botch it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>&quot;Let us in! We want to see!&quot; They&#39;re on their knees. They&#39;re slithering in the ooze. They&#39;re interviewing the dog, the cat, the rhododendrons…</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>No more red glow… he must be out of the fireball… seven g&#39;s were driving him back into the seat… He could hear the Cape capcom: &quot;… How do you read? Over.&quot; That meant he had passed through the ionosphere and was entering the lower atmosphere. &quot;Loud and clear; how me?&quot; &quot;Roger, reading you loud and clear. How are you doing?&quot; &quot;Oh, pretty good.&quot; &quot;Roger. Your impact point is within one mile of the up-range destroyer.&quot; Oh, pretty good. It wasn&#39;t Yeager, but it wasn&#39;t bad.</p>

He was inside of one and a half tons of non-aerodynamic metal. He was a hundred thousand feet up, dropping toward the ocean like an enormous cannonball. The capsule had no aerodynamic qualities whatsoever at this altitude.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>That was what the sight of John Glenn did to Americans at that time. It primed them for the tears. And those tears ran like a river all over America. It was an extraordinary thing, being the sort of mortal who brought tears to other men&#39;s eyes.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There were thousands of people lining the streets. They did not make a sound, however. They stood there four and five deep at the curbs, sweating and staring. They sweated a river and they stared ropes. They just stared and sweated. The seven lads, each in his emblazoned convertible, were standing up grinning and waving, and the wives were smiling and waving, and the children were smiling and looking around—everyone was doing the usual—and the crowds just stared back. They didn&#39;t even smile. They looked at them with a morose curiosity, as if they were prisoners of war or had come from Alpha Centauri and no one was sure whether or not they comprehended the local lingo.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It was always someone such as Herb Snout from Kar Kastle, and he would come up and say: &quot;Hi, there! Herb Snout! Kar Kastle! Listen! We&#39;re damned glad to have you folks here, just damned glad, goddamn it!&quot; And then he would turn to one of the wives, whose hands were so full of cow meat she couldn&#39;t budge, and he would bend down and turn on a huge Karo-syrup grin, to show his deference to the ladies, and say in a suddenly huge voice that would make the poor startled woman drop the reeking maroon all over her lap: &quot;Hi, there, little lady! Just damned glad to see you, too!&quot; And then he&#39;d give a huge horrible wink that would practically implode his eye, and he&#39;d say, &quot;We&#39;ve heard a lot of good things about you gals, a lot of good things&quot;—all with this eye-wrenching wink.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>and out into the spotlight pranced an ancient woman with yellow hair and a white mask of a face… Her flesh looked like the meat of a casaba melon in the winter… She carried some enormous plumed fans… She began her famous striptease act… Sally Rand!… who had been an aging but still famous stripper when the seven brave lads were in their teens, during the Depression… Oh-owwwwwwwww wahwahwah… and she winked and minced about and took off a little here and covered up a little there and shook her ancient haunches at the seven single-combat warriors. It was electrifying. It was quite beyond sex, show business, and either the sins or rigors of the flesh. It was two o&#39;clock in the afternoon on the Fourth of July, and the cows burned on, and the whiskey roared goddamned glad to see you and the Venus de Houston shook her fanny in an utterly baffling blessing over it all.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Bucket nostalgia for the early days, the Langley era, the</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>For both the wives and the men there was at first an Oaken Bucket</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The whole thing was baffling. On the upper reaches of the great ziggurat the subject of race had never been introduced before. The unspoken premise was that you either had the right stuff or you didn&#39;t, and no other variables mattered.</p>
