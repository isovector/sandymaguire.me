    <p>I said, “Hey Jack, how you doing? That sure is a fine silk girl, huh? You got a square to spare?” He fished a cigarette from his red shirt pocket, handed it to me and said, “Yeh Kid, she’s fine as a Valentine. Two sights I ain’t never seen and that is a pretty bulldog, and an ugly white woman.”
</p>

    <p>He took the bait like a rapist in a nudist colony for the blind.

    <p>Oscar went from the hospital into the hole for fifteen days. The charges, “possession of contraband food” and “physical aggression against an officer.” I was there and the only aggression on Oscar’s part was the natural resistance of his flesh and bone to that steel cane. The parole board met in the joint every month to consider applications. Every con, when he had served to within several months of his minimum, started dreaming

    <p>The junkie bastard was jeffing on me, lashing me with contempt and scorn. Old pimps always know when a youngster with a yen for the pimp game is desperate for advice.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He would say, “Always remember whether you be sucker or hustler in the world out there, you’ve got that vital edge if you can iron-clad your feelings. I picture the human mind as a movie screen. If you’re a dopey sucker, you’ll just sit and watch all kinds of mindwrecking, damn fool movies on that screen.” He said. “Son, there is no reason except a stupid one for anybody to project on that screen anything that will worry him or dull that vital edge. After all, we are the absolute bosses of that whole theatre and show in our minds. We even write the script. So always write positive, dynamic scripts and show only the best movies for you on that screen whether you are pimp or priest.”

    <p>“Old Weeping fell dead outside a shooting gallery in Saint Paul. Musta’ shot some pure, cause a lookout on the sidewalk heard him mumble before he croaked. Well kiss my dead mammy’s ass if this ain’t the best smack I ever shot.”
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>She was comical like that fire-and-brimstone preacher. He was trying to hide his hard-on from the cute sister in the front pew flashing her cat for him.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>My headlights beamed on a squatting junkie whore with a Dracula face peeing in the gutter. She grinned toothlessly into the glare like maybe she was a starlet taking bows at a movie premiere
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He sang, “Shootin’ ’em up inside, heavy and good. Scratch piled up like cords of wood. Geez you look lucky, Jack. Seven, eleven point right back. That’s sure you, Jack. Go in fast. Come out quicker. Lady Luck is a bitch but you can stick her.”
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I jerked my head away from the sight of her like she was Medusa.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He looked like a black baby who had taken ugly pills.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I said, “Who is that?” The dwarf said, “You gotta be from outta town. That Sweet Jones. He’s the greatest Nigger pimp in the world.” The thin joker said, “That spotted cat, Miss Peaches, is the only bitch he cares lives or croaks. Shit, them whores you pinning ain’t but half the stable. If they got Nigger pimps in outer space, he’s the best of them, too.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I started hoofing that thousand miles to Mr. Jones. On the way I dusted off the hundred-and-seventy-five I. Q. in my skull.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I told you he’s nuts. You keep it up, a ground hog will be your mailman.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I threw a fin on the log. The Mexican showed me her choppers like I was her dentist.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I was going inside to call for help when our heavenly bodies collided. Is it possible that you’re not oblivious to the esoteric aspects of car repair?
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I’ll nut roll on her. I’ll stay outta the pimp role until I case her. I’ll go Sweet William on her.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>turned my back to the sunlight. I felt old Morpheus slugging his velvet hammer against my eyelids.

    <p>“Lord, I’m not asking you to bless my pimping. I ain’t that stupid. Lord, I know you ain’t black. Surely you know, if you’re up there, what it’s like to be black down here. These white folks are doing all the fine living and sucking up all the gravy. I gotta have some of that living and some of that gravy. “I don’t wanta be a stickup man or a dope peddler. I sure as hell won’t be a porter or dishwasher. I just wanta pimp that’s all. It’s not too bad, because whores are rotten. Besides I ain’t going to croak them or drive them crazy. I’m just going to pimp some real whitetype living out of them.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I wondered if the copper was Satan and I had croaked in the Hog and was being checked into Hell. Hell or not, Satan wanted identification
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>She said, “I don’t drink and besides I don’t know you.” I said, “You met me in your first hot dream, remember? You know that pretty joker in your little girl dreams that always faded when you woke up wet between the legs. You waited and wished.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Twilight was sweeping away daylight with a deep purple broom.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“How old are you, Daddy? I bet you’re nineteen.” I said, “Bitch, I’m a hundred-and-nineteen. I just got a pretty baby face.”
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>luck on me. The two held onto me like I was Sutton.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>stud is got a rep as a fast-rod joker. He ain’t got no direct syndicate
</p>

    <p>We were in Iowa when Helen stung a rich sod-buster for seventy-two hundred. I was in bed when she threw it on the bed. Excited? Sure I was. My heart boomed like bombs going off. She didn’t know it. I was icy cool. I casually scooped it up and counted it. I had a poker face. I said, “Now listen, bitch. Run this sting down. I gotta know how hot this scratch is. Did you get all the sucker had? I’ll be a salty sonuvabitch to read in the papers that you missed a bundle.”
