    <p>“Standard” English was established empirically and by individuals, by contrast with the product elsewhere of state-supported academies. Since the early English Protestants wanted to help ordinary readers understand the Bible in English, the mainstream of English lexicography, as Allen Walker Read explains, flowed from the lists of words collected to help the devout. One of the first such lists was appended to William Tyndale’s English translation of the Pentateuch in 1530.

    <p>Estienne’s use of the “best authors” provided the means by which lexicographers set up their standards of correctness for the new national languages. The first comprehensive standard dictionary in a single language, a product of twenty years of work by the Accademia della Crusca, appeared in Venice in 1612 and offered the pattern for other authoritative monolingual European dictionaries. The leader in this project, Leonardo Salviati (1540–1589), used the power of the press to legislate the Tuscan dialect into the standard Italian language. He drew from the great writers of Florence, canonized Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, and so made theirs the language for an Italian nation still three centuries in the future. Some say it was the Italian language that created the nation.

    <p>A profitable but uncelebrated by-product of the grandeur of ancient Rome was the medieval trade in building materials. For at least ten centuries Roman marble cutters made a business of excavating ruins, dismantling ancient buildings, and digging up old pavements to find models for their own work and materials for new construction.

    <p>pious Christians still found the Biblical chronology by which Archbishop Ussher had fixed the creation at 4004 B.C. too comforting to abandon. For them the whole course of early history seemed to run from Eden through Jerusalem, and was amply chronicled in the Bible. The ancient events that concerned Christians had occurred exclusively in and around the Mediterranean, and the human heritage was the heritage of Greece and Rome.
