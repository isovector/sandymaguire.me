    <p>The autumn leaves blew over the moonlit pavement in such a way as to make the girl who was moving there seem fixed to a sliding walk, letting the motion of the wind and the leaves carry</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The bloodstream in this woman was new and it seemed to have done a new thing to her. Her cheeks were very pink and her lips were very fresh and full of colour and they looked soft and relaxed. Someone else&#39;s blood there. If only someone else&#39;s flesh and brain and memory. If only they could have taken her mind along to the dry-cleaner&#39;s and emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked it and brought it back in the morning. If only…</p>

    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Come on now, we&#39;re going to go build a mirror-factory first and put out nothing but mirrors for the next year</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>and take a long look in them.”</p>
