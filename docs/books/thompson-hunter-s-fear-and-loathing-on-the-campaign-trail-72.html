    <p>When a man gives up drugs he wants big fires in his life—all night long, every night, huge flames in the fireplace</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>When a man gives up drugs he wants big fires in his life—all</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“He’d be a fine President,” they say, “but of course he can’t possibly win.” Why not? Well… the wizards haven’t bothered to explain that, but their reasoning appears to be rooted in the hazy idea that the people who could make McGovern President—that huge &amp; confused coalition of students, freaks, blacks, anti-war activists &amp; dazed dropouts—won’t even bother to register, much less drag themselves to the polls on election day.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>it is hard to recall many candidates, in recent history, who failed to move what is now called “The McGovern Vote” to the polls if they actually represented it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The mere mention of Kennedy’s name is said to give Nixon bad cramps all over his body, such as it is. His thugs are already starting to lash Kennedy with vicious denunciations—calling him a “liar” and a “coward” and a “cheater.” And this is only December of 1971; the election is still ten months away.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“To hell with Butz,” I said, “what about Rehnquist? Are they actually going to put a swine like that on the Supreme Court?” “They have the votes,” he replied. “Jesus,” I muttered, “is he as bad as all the rotten stuff I’ve read about him?” “Worse,” Flug said.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“To hell with Butz,” I said, “what about Rehnquist? Are they actually going to put a swine like that on the Supreme Court?” “They have the votes,” he replied. “Jesus,” I muttered, “is he as bad as all the rotten stuff I’ve read about him?” “Worse,” Flug said. “But I think he’s in. We tried, but we can’t get the votes.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>What Nixon and Mitchell have done in three years—despite the best efforts of the sharpest and meanest young turks the Democratic opposition can call on—is reduce the U.S. Supreme Court to the level of a piss-poor bowling team in Memphis—and this disastrous, nazi-bent shift of the federal government’s Final-Decision-making powers won’t even begin to take effect until the spring of ’72.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The effects of this takeover are potentially so disastrous—in terms of personal freedom and police power—that there is no point even speculating on the fate of some poor, misguided geek who might want to take his “Illegal Search &amp; Seizure” case all the way up to the top.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>This world is full of dangerous beasts—but none quite as ugly and uncontrollable as a lawyer who has finally flipped off the tracks of Reason. He will run completely amok—like a Priest into sex, or a narc-squad cop who suddenly decides to start sampling his contraband. Yes… and… uh, where were we? I have a bad tendency to rush off on mad tangents and pursue them for fifty or sixty pages that get so out of control that I end up burning them, for my own good.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>it’s probably safe to say, right now, that there is not a single presidential candidate, media guru, or backstairs politics wizard in Washington who honestly believes the “youth vote” will have more than a marginal, splinter-vote effect on the final outcome of the 1972 presidential campaign. These kids are turned off from politics, they say. Most of ’em don’t even want to hear about it. All they want to do these days is lie around on waterbeds and smoke that goddamn marrywanna…</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Levis don’t make it in this town; if you show up wearing Levis they figure you’re either a servant or a messenger. This is particularly true at high-level press conferences, where any deviation from standard journalistic dress is considered rude and perhaps even dangerous.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The only people who seem genuinely interested in the ’72 elections are the actual participants—the various candidates, their paid staff people, the thousands of journalists, cameramen &amp; other media-connected hustlers who will spend most of this year humping the campaign along… and of course all the sponsors, called “fat cats” in the language of Now-Politics, who stand to gain hugely for at least the next four years if they can muscle their man down the homestretch just a hair ahead of the others.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The root assumption here is that neither party would nominate a man more than 20 percent different from the type of person most Americans consider basically right and acceptable. Which almost always happens. There is no potentially serious candidate in either major party this year who couldn’t pass for the executive vice-president for mortgage loans in any hometown bank from Bangor to San Diego.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>On balance, they are a pretty bland lot.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>How many more of these goddamn elections are we going to have to write off as lame but “regrettably necessary” holding actions? And how many more of these stinking, double-downer sideshows will we have to go through before we can get ourselves straight enough to put together some kind of national election that will give me and the at least 20 million people I tend to agree with a chance to vote for something, instead of always being faced with that old familiar choice between the lesser of two evils?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In other words, the weight of the evidence filtering down from the high brain-rooms of both the New York Times and the Washington Post seems to say we’re all fucked.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The importance of Liking Yourself is a notion that fell heavily out of favor during the coptic, anti-ego frenzy of the Acid Era—but nobody guessed, back then, that the experiment might churn up this kind of hangover: a whole subculture of frightened illiterates with no faith in anything.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Once they let you get away with running around for ten years like a king hoodlum, you tend to forget now and then that about half the people you meet live from one day to the next in a state of such fear and uncertainty that about half the time they honestly doubt their own sanity.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Could she handle that madness? Probably not. And even if she could, why do it? A political campaign is a very narrow ritual, where anything weird is unwelcome. I am trouble enough by myself; they would never tolerate me if I showed up with a nervous blonde nymphet who thought politics was some kind of game played by old people, like bridge.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Kilpatrick, the famous crypto-nazi newspaper columnist. He made no attempt to sit with us, but he made sure that everybody in the room knew exactly who he was. He kept calling the bartender</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>sure that everybody in the room knew exactly who he was. He kept calling the bartender “Jim,” which was not his name, and the bartender,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He kept calling the bartender “Jim,” which was not his name, and the bartender, becoming more &amp; more nervous, began addressing Kilpatrick as “Mr. Reynolds.” Finally Kilpatrick lost his temper. “My name’s not Reynolds, goddamnit! I’m James J. Kilpatrick of the Washington Evening Star.” Then he hauled his paunch off the chair and reeled out to the lobby.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There are only two ways to make it in big-time politics today: One is to come on like a mean dinosaur, with a high-powered machine that scares the shit out of your entrenched opposition (like Daley or Nixon)… and the other is to tap the massive, frustrated energies of a mainly young, disillusioned electorate that has long since abandoned the idea that we all have a duty to vote. This is like being told you have a duty to buy a new car, but you have to choose immediately between a Ford and a Chevy.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the argument over “Amnesty,”—which is nothing more or less than a proposal to grant presidential pardon to all draft dodgers and U.S. military deserters, on the grounds that history has absolved them. Because if the Vietnam War was wrong from the start—as even Nixon has tacitly admitted—then it is hard to avoid the logic of the argument that says the Anti-War Exiles were right for refusing to fight it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>it still seems perfectly logical to assume that an audience of first-time voters might be at least momentarily confused by a Left/Champion Democratic candidate who says in one breath that his opponent is dead wrong on a very crucial issue… and then in the next breath says he plans to support that opponent if he wins the nomination. I doubt if I was the only person in the hall, at that moment, who thought: “Well, shit… if you plan to support him in July, why not support him now, and get it over with?”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>we have all learned a hell of a lot about the realities of Politics in America. Even the politicians have learned—but, as usual, the politicians are much slower than the people they want to lead.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Who is going to explain in 1976 that all the people who felt they got burned in ’72 should “try again” for another bogus challenger? Four years from now there will be two entire generations—between the ages of twenty-two and forty—who will not give a hoot in hell about any election, and their apathy will be rooted in personal experience. Four years from now it will be very difficult to convince anybody who has gone from Johnson/Goldwater to Humphrey/Nixon to Nixon/Muskie that there is any possible reason for getting involved in another bullshit election.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>But T. S. Eliot put them all in a sack when he coughed up that line about… what was it? Have these Dangerous Drugs fucked my memory? Maybe so.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>On the face of it, the “McGovern problem” looks like the ultimate proof-positive for the liberal cynics’ conviction that there is no room in American politics for an honest man. Which is probably true: if you take it for granted—along</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>LBJ was re-elected as the “Peace Candidate.” Johnson did a lot of rotten things in those five bloody years, but when the history books are written he will emerge in his proper role as the man who caused an entire generation of Americans to lose all respect for the Presidency, the White House, the Army, and in fact the whole structure of “government.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>(The Omnibus Safe Streets &amp; Crime Control Act of 1968, a genuinely oppressive piece of legislation… even Lyndon Johnson was shocked by it, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to veto the bugger—for the same reasons cited by the many Senators who called the bill “frightening” while refusing to vote against it because they didn’t want to be on record as having voted against “safe streets and crime control.” The bare handful of Senators who actually voted against the bill explained themselves in very ominous terms. For details, see Justice by Richard Harris.)</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>things are different in Washington. It’s not that everybody you talk to is aggressively hostile to any idea that might faze their well-ordered lifestyles; they’d just rather not think about it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>there is no sense of life in the Underculture. On the national reality spectrum, Washington’s Doper/Left/Rock/Radical community is somewhere between Toledo and Biloxi. “Getting it on” in Washington means killing a pint of Four Roses and then arguing about Foreign Aid, over chicken wings, with somebody’s drunken Congressman.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The Post will have a story about Muskie making a speech in Iowa. The Star will say the same thing, and the Journal will say nothing at all. But the Times might have enough room on the jump page to include a line or so that says something like: “When he finished his speech, Muskie burst into tears and seized his campaign manager by the side of the neck. They grappled briefly, but the struggle was kicked apart by an oriental woman who seemed to be in control.” Now that’s good journalism. Totally objective; very active and straight to the point.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The public expects no less. They want a man who can zap around the nation like a goddamn methedrine bat: Racing from airport to airport, from one crisis to another—sucking up the news and then spewing it out by the “Five W’s” in a package that makes perfect sense.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The nut of the problem is that covering this presidential campaign is so fucking dull that it’s just barely tolerable… and the only thing worse than going out on the campaign trail and getting hauled around in a booze-frenzy from one speech to another is having to come back to Washington and write about it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Lindsay seems almost suicidally frank at times; he will spend two hours on a stage, dutifully haranguing a crowd about whatever topic his speechwriters have laid out for him that day… and thirty minutes later he will sit down with a beer and say something that no politician in his right mind would normally dare to stay in the presence of journalists.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>politicians with a certain amount of awe and respect. But the prevailing attitude among journalists with enough status to work Presidential Campaigns is that all politicians are congenital thieves and liars. This is usually true. Or at least as valid as the consensus opinion among politicians that The Press is a gang of swine.</p>

    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“I didn’t really want the goddamn things anyway.” Which was true. Getting barred from the White House is like being blackballed at the Playboy Club. There are definite advantages to having your name on the Ugly List in places like that.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I sit here on my yellow lamp-lit porch, swilling rum, and work up a fine gut-level understanding of what it must feel like to be a wild dog.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Ted Kennedy is facing almost exactly the same situation today. He would rather not run: The odds are bad; his natural constituency has apparently abandoned politics; Nixon seems to have all the guns, and all he needs to make his life complete is the chance to stomp a Kennedy in his final campaign. So it is hard to argue with the idea that Teddy would be a fool to run for President now. Nineteen seventy-six is only four years away. Kennedy is only forty-two years old, and when Nixon bows out, the GOP will have to crank up a brand new champion to stave off the Kennedy challenge.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A story like this one is very hard to spike, because people involved in a presidential campaign are so conditioned to devious behavior on all fronts—including the press—that something like that fiasco in the Miami train station is just about impossible for them to understand except in terms of a conspiracy. Why else, after all, would I give my credentials to some booze-maddened jailbird?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Getting assigned to cover Nixon in ’68 was like being sentenced to six months in a Holiday Inn. It never occurred to me that anything could be worse than getting stuck on another Nixon campaign, so it came as a definite shock to find that hanging around Florida with Ed Muskie was even duller and more depressing than traveling with Evil Dick himself.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I never saw the new ones, but the Squier originals were definitely a bit queer. They depicted Muskie as an extremely slow-spoken man who had probably spent half his life overcoming some kind of dreadful speech impediment, only to find himself totally hooked on a bad Downer habit or maybe even smack. The first time I heard a Muskie radio spot I was zipping along on the Rickenbacker Causeway, coming in from Key Biscayne, and I thought it was a new Cheech &amp; Chong record. It was the voice of a man who had done about twelve Reds on the way to the studio—a very funny ad.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>That may be the handle. Maybe the whole secret of turning a crowd on is getting turned on yourself by the crowd.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>his sense of humor is so dry that a lot of people insist on calling it “withered.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Muskie has apparently grown accustomed to this kind of waterhead talk from his staff. They are not an impressive group, on the evidence.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If the Democratic Party nominates Humphrey again in ’72, the Party will get exactly what it deserves.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There is a strange psychic connection between Bobby Kennedy’s voice and the sound of the Rolling Stones. They were part of the same trip, that wild sense of breakthrough in the late Sixties when almost anything seemed possible.</p>
