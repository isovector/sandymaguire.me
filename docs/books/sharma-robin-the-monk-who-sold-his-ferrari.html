    <p>Sure I am that this day we are masters of our fate, that the task which has been set before us is not above our strength; that its pangs and toils are not beyond my endurance. As long as we have faith in our own cause and an unconquerable will to win, victory will not be denied us.</p>

    <p>As those three years passed, I changed from an overworked young lawyer to a jaded, somewhat cynical older lawyer.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The fast pace and endless demands had worn him out and run him down. He admitted that his body had fallen apart and that his mind had lost its lustre.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>My life became so much simpler and meaningful when I left the baggage of my past behind. The moment I stopped spending so much time chasing the big pleasures of life, I began to enjoy the little ones,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The longer I listened to Julian, the more I came to realize that my own spirit had become rusty. What had happened to the uncommon passion I brought to everything I did when I was younger?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Yogi Raman would sit with his enthusiastic student and fill his mind with insights on the meaning of life and little-known techniques that he had mastered for living with greater vitality, creativity and fulfillment. He taught Julian ancient principles which he said anyone could use to live longer, stay younger and grow far happier.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>just like this cup, you seem to be full of your own ideas. And how can any more go in … until you first empty your cup?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Investing in yourself is the best investment you will ever make. It will not only improve your life, it will improve the lives of all those around you.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Carl Jung once said, ‘Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakens.’</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>No matter what happens to you in your life, you alone have the capacity to choose your response to it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I remember him telling me that one of them said that the Chinese character for ‘crisis’ is composed of two sub-characters: one that spells ‘danger’ and another that spells ‘opportunity.’ I guess that even the ancient Chinese knew that there is a bright side to the darkest circumstance — if you have the courage to look for it.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>begin to live out of the glory of your imagination, not your memory.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>When you are inspired by some great purpose, some extraordinary project, all of your thoughts break their bonds: your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction and you find yourself in a new, great and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents become alive, and you discover yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed yourself to be.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I think my mental muscles have grown a little flabby.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>what risks should I take?” “Stop being so practical. Start doing the things you have always wanted to do. I have known lawyers who have quit their jobs to become stage actors and accountants who have become jazz musicians. In the process, they have found the deep happiness that had eluded them for so long. So what if they could no longer afford two vacations a year and a posh summer home in the Caymans? Calculated risk taking will pay huge dividends.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>saying that you don’t have time to improve your thoughts and your life is like saying you don’t have time to stop for gas because you are too busy driving. Eventually it will catch up with you.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Yogi Raman became the person whom he mentally saw himself becoming. You see, John, the mind works through pictures. Pictures affect your self-image, and your self-image affects the way you feel, act and achieve. If your self-image tells you that you are too young to be a successful lawyer or too old to change your habits for the better, you never will achieve these goals. If your self-image tells you that lives rich with purpose, excellent health and happiness are only for people from backgrounds other than your own, this prophecy will ultimately become your reality.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>You must spend some time every day, even if it is just a few minutes, in the practice of creative envisioning. See yourself as you want to be, whether this means serving as a great judge, a great father or a great citizen of your community.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>‘There is nothing noble about being superior to some other person. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self.’</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>You can do whatever you want to do as long as it is correct according to your conscience and your heart.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into the flames of achievement.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>anyone can revolutionize their lives once they revolutionize the direction in which they are moving. But if you don’t even know where you are going, how will you ever know when you get there?”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“You practice the art of kaizen by pushing yourself daily. Work hard to improve your mind and body. Nourish your spirit. Do the things you fear. Start to live with unbridled energy and limitless enthusiasm. Watch the sun rise. Dance in a rain shower. Be the person you dream of being.</p>
