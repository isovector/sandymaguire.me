    <p>After dinner I went off by myself, opened my engagement book, and thought over all the interviews, discussions and meetings that had taken place during the week. I asked myself: ‘“What mistakes did I make that time?” ‘“What did I do that was right – and in what way could I have improved my performance?” ‘“What lessons can I learn from that experience?”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>‘I often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I was frequently astonished at my own blunders. Of course, as the years passed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I was inclined to pat myself on the back a little after one of these sessions. This system of self-analysis, self-education, continued year after year, did more for me than any other one thing I have ever attempted.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If Al Capone, ‘Two Gun’ Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate men and women behind prison walls don’t blame themselves for anything – what about the people with whom you and I come in contact?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>‘I learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.’</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing their hard hat, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the job. The result was increased compliance with the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers, blaming everybody but themselves. We are all like that.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>That was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln’s life. It taught him an invaluable lesson in the art of dealing with people. Never again did he write an insulting letter. Never again did he ridicule anyone. And from that time on, he almost never criticised anybody for anything.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Anyhow, it is water under the bridge now. If I send this letter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify himself. It will make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Benjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so adroit at handling people, that he was made American Ambassador to France. The secret of his success? ‘I will speak ill of no man,’ he said, ‘. . . and speak all the good I know of everybody.’</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Any fool can criticise, condemn and complain – and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>PRINCIPLE 1 Don’t criticise, condemn or complain.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>John Dewey, one of America’s most profound philosophers, phrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is ‘the desire to be important.’ Remember that phrase: ‘the desire to be important.’ It is significant. You are going to hear a lot about it in this book.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Lincoln once began a letter saying: ‘Everybody likes a compliment.’</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>William James said: ‘The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.’ He didn’t speak, mind you, of the ‘wish’ or the ‘desire’ or the ‘longing’ to be appreciated. He said the ‘craving’ to be appreciated.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I’ll tell you what you are. That determines your character.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>‘There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticise anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Be ‘hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,’ and people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime – repeat them years after you have forgotten them.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>PRINCIPLE 2 Give honest and sincere appreciation.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: ‘How can I make this person want to do it?’</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>‘If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.’</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>All this talk about your enormous success makes me feel small and unimportant.]</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>My ten years of bank experience should be of interest to a rapidly growing bank like yours. In various capacities in bank operations with the Bankers Trust Company in New York, leading to my present assignment as Branch Manager, I have acquired skills in all phases of banking including depositor relations, credits, loans and administration. I will be relocating to Phoenix in May and I am sure I can contribute to your growth and profit. I will be in Phoenix the week of April 3 and would appreciate the opportunity to show you how I can help your bank meet its goals. Sincerely, Barbara L. Anderson</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>PRINCIPLE 3 Arouse in the other person an eager want.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He told me that many magicians would look at the audience and say to themselves, ‘Well, there is a bunch of suckers out there, a bunch of hicks; I’ll fool them all right.’ But Thurston’s method was totally different. He told me that every time he went on stage he said to himself: ‘I am grateful because these people come to see me. They make it possible for me to make my living in a very agreeable way. I’m going to give them the very best I possibly can.’</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to do things for other people – things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>EVERYONE WHO WAS ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt was astonished at the range and diversity of his knowledge. Whether his visitor was a cowboy or a Rough Rider, a New York politician or a diplomat, Roosevelt knew what to say. And how was it done? The answer was simple. Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>For Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>PRINCIPLE 5 Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>‘Talk to people about themselves,’ said Disraeli, one of the shrewdest men who ever ruled the British Empire. ‘Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.’</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
