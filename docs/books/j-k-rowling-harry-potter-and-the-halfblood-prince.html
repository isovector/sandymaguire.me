    <p>“I don’t mean to be rude—” he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable. “—yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,” Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. “Best to say nothing at all, my dear man.</p>

    <p>let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.”</p>

    <p>“People expect you to have cooler friends than us,” said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.</p>

    <p>I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being—forgive me—rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.”</p>

    <p>“we are going to enter my memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance.” “Not of great importance?” repeated Harry incredulously. “Professor, did you understand—?” “Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me,”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>’S’no wonder Dumbledore’s angry with Sn—” Hagrid stopped in his tracks, a familiar, guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his tangled black beard. “What?” said Harry quickly. “Dumbledore’s angry with Snape?” “I never said tha’,” said Hagrid, though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway.</p>

    <p>“Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the subject myself.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“Well, I asked Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he wouldn’t give it to me.” There was a little silence. “I see,” said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. “And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Voldemort after a short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school.” “Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard such as myself, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you once saw the attraction of teaching too.” “I see</p>

    <p>Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth…</p>

    <p>“But I got this far, didn’t I?” he said slowly. “They thought I’d die in the attempt, but I’m here… and you’re in my power… I’m the one with the wand… You’re at my mercy…” “No, Draco,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.”</p>
