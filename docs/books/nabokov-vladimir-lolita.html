    <p>Reverting to his professional state, he drove the Humberts to their residence and all the way Valeria talked, and Humbert the Terrible deliberated with Humbert the Small whether Humbert Humbert should kill her or her lover, or both, or neither.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I was treated last night to one of those dazzling coincidences that logicians loathe and poets love.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>after a winter of ennui and pneumonia</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>No temptations maddened me. The plump, glossy little Eskimo girls with their fish smell, hideous raven hair and guinea pig faces, evoked even less desire in me than Dr. Johnson had. Nymphets do not occur in polar regions.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I discovered there was an endless source of robust enjoyment in trifling with psychiatrists: cunningly leading them on; never letting them see that you know all the tricks of the trade; inventing for them elaborate dreams, pure classics in style (which make them, the dream-extortionists, dream and wake up shrieking); teasing them with fake “primal scenes”; and never allowing them the slightest glimpse of one’s real sexual predicament</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I passed by her in my adult disguise (a great big handsome hunk of movieland manhood),</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Mr. Edgar H. Humbert (I threw in the “Edgar” just for the heck of it), “writer and explorer.” McCoo’s brother, when taking it down, asked me what I had written. Whatever I told him came out as “several books on Peacock, Rainbow and other poets.” It was also noted that Charlotte and I had known each other for several years and that I was a distant relation of her first husband. I hinted I had had an affair with her thirteen years ago but this was not mentioned in print. To Charlotte I said that society columns should contain a shimmer of errors.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>otherwise her autobiography was as devoid of interests as her autopsy would have been.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Had Charlotte been Valeria, I would have known how to handle the situation; and “handle” is the word I want. In the good old days, by merely twisting fat Valechka’s brittle wrist (the one she had fallen upon from a bicycle) I could make her change her mind instantly; but anything of the sort in regard to Charlotte was unthinkable. Bland American Charlotte frightened me.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>there was Charlotte swimming on with dutiful awkwardness (she was a very mediocre mermaid),</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“I have a surprise for you,” she said looking at me with fond eyes over a spoonful of soup. “In the fall we two are going to England.” I swallowed my spoonful, wiped my lips with pink paper (Oh, the cool rich linens of Mirana Hotel!) and said: “I have also a surprise for you, my dear. We two are not going to England.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>went to see “our” doctor, a friendly fellow whose perfect bedside manner and complete reliance on a few patented drugs adequately masked his ignorance of, and indifference to, medical science.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>he produced a vial of violet-blue capsules banded with dark purple at one end, which, he said, had just been placed on the market and were intended not for neurotics whom a draft of water could calm if properly administered, but only for great sleepless artists who had to die for a few hours in order to live for centuries.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>with an air of perfect savoir vivre and gentlemanly generosity, he offered to pay the funeral-home expenses. He expected me to refuse his offer. With a drunken sob of gratitude I accepted it. This took him aback. Slowly, incredulously, he repeated what he had said. I thanked him again, even more profusely than before.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>She it was to whom ads were dedicated:</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Lo, who despite a certain brash alertness of manner and spurts of wit was not as intelligent a child as her I.Q. might suggest.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>a charwoman and cook of sorts whom I had inherited with the vacuum cleaner from the previous tenants.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>First of all the old ogre drew up a list under “absolutely forbidden” and another under “reluctantly allowed.” Absolutely forbidden were dates, single or double or triple—the next step being of course mass orgy.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Mrs. Holigan, who smelled of the plague</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I had no other alternative than to pursue on foot the winged fugitive.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It occurred to me that if I were really losing my mind, I might end by murdering somebody. In fact—said high-and-dry Humbert to floundering Humbert—it might be quite clever to prepare things—to transfer the weapon from box to pocket—so as to be ready to take advantage of the spell of insanity when it does come.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>swam in it like excrements in the blue sea water in Nice.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>swam in it like excrements in the blue sea water in Nice.</p>

    <p>He did not use a fountain pen which fact, as any psychoanalyst will tell you, meant that the patient was a repressed undinist.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>What a shiver of triumph and loathing shook my frail frame when, among the plain innocent names in the hotel recorder, his fiendish conundrum would ejaculate in my face!</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He guessed Bill and he would be going back to fix those wires. He guessed Mr. Haze and Dolly had loads of things to say to each other. He guessed he would be seeing me before I left. Why do those people guess so much and shave so little, and are so disdainful of hearing aids?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>agreement with the so-called authorities. Then, as I drove away, I heard her</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I was surprised (this a rhetorical figure, I was not)</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>presently I was driving through the drizzle of the dying day, with the windshield wipers in full action but unable to cope with my</p>

    <p>I was driving through the drizzle of the dying day, with the windshield wipers in full action but unable to cope with my tears.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I picked up her book. It was some trash for young people.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The road now stretched across open country, and it occurred to me—not by way of protest, not as a symbol, or anything like that, but merely as a novel experience—that since I had disregarded all laws of humanity, I might as well disregard the rules of traffic.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Teachers of Literature are apt to think up such problems as “What is the author’s purpose?” or still worse “What is the guy trying to say?” Now, I happen to be the kind of author who in starting to work on a book has no other purpose than to get rid of that book</p>
