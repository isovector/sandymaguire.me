    <p>Most of the time, chess was the only language between them. One afternoon when they had spent three or four hours on endgame analysis she said wearily, “Don’t you get bored sometimes?” and he looked at her blankly. “What else is there?” he said.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He looked at her thoughtfully for a moment. “You are nineteen?” “Yes.” “I have gone over your games at this tournament.” He paused. “You are a marvel, my dear. I may have just played the best chess player of my life.” She was unable to speak. She stared at him in disbelief. He smiled at her. “You will get used to it,” he said.</p>
