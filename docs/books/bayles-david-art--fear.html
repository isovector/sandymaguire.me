    <p>Making art provides uncomfortably accurate feedback about the gap that inevitably exists between what you intended to do, and what you did.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>To all viewers but yourself, what matters is the product: the finished artwork. To you, and you alone, what matters is the process: the experience of shaping that artwork.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>a mutual friend whose single-minded quest, for twenty years, was to land a one-man show at his city’s major art museum. He finally got it. And never produced a serious piece of art again. There’s a painful irony to stories like that, to discovering how frequently and easily success transmutes into depression.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Avoiding this fate has something to do with not letting your current goal become your only goal.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>OPERATING MANUAL FOR NOT QUITTING a. Make friends with others who make art, and share your in-progress work with each other frequently. b. Learn to think of [A], rather than the Museum of Modern Art, as the destination of your work. (Look at it this way: If all goes well, MOMA will eventually come to you.)</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>David Bayles, to be exact — who began piano studies with a Master. After a few months’ practice, David lamented to his teacher, “But I can hear the music so much better in my head than I can get out of my fingers.” To which the Master replied, “What makes you think that ever changes?”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Imagination is in control when you begin making an object. The artwork’s potential is never higher than in that magic moment when the first brushstroke is applied, the first chord struck. But as the piece grows, technique and craft take over, and imagination becomes a less useful tool.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“What’s so hard about that first sentence is that you’re stuck with it. Everything else is going to flow out of that sentence. And by the time you’ve laid down the first two sentences, your options are all gone.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the piece you make is always one step removed from what you imagined, or what else you can imagine, or what you’re right on the edge of being able to imagine.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>he devoted only about one percent of his energy to conceiving a design — and the remaining ninety-nine percent to holding onto it as a project ran its course.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>your imagination is free to race a hundred works ahead, conceiving pieces you could and perhaps should and maybe one day will execute — but not today, not in the piece at hand. All you can work on today is directly in front of you. Your job is to develop an imagination of the possible.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A finished piece is, in effect, a test of correspondence between imagination and execution. And perhaps surprisingly, the more common obstacle to achieving that correspondence is not undisciplined execution, but undisciplined imagination.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“The poem in the head is always perfect. Resistance begins when you try to convert it into language.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>most artists don’t daydream about making great art — they daydream about having made great art.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The artist’s life is frustrating not because the passage is slow, but because he imagines it to be fast.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Materials are like elementary particles: charged, but indifferent. They do not listen in on your fantasies, do not get up and move in response to your idle wishes. The blunt truth is, they do precisely what your hands make them do. The paint lays exactly where you put it; the words you wrote — not the ones you needed to write or thought about writing — are the only ones that appear on the paper.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The truth is that the piece of art which seems so profoundly right in its finished state may earlier have been only inches or seconds away from total collapse.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Lincoln doubted his capacity to express what needed to be said at Gettysburg, yet pushed ahead anyway, knowing he was doing the best he could to present the ideas he needed to share.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>What’s really needed is nothing more than a broad sense of what you are looking for, some strategy for how to find it, and an overriding willingness to embrace mistakes and surprises along the way.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The fear that you’re only pretending to do art is the (readily predictable) consequence of doubting your own artistic credentials. After all, you know better than anyone else the accidental nature of much that appears in your art, not to mention all those elements you know originated with others</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It’s easy to imagine that real artists know what they’re doing, and that they — unlike you — are entitled to feel good about themselves and their art. Fear that you are not a real artist causes you to undervalue your work.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The increasing prevalence of reflexive art — art that looks inward, taking itself as its subject — may to some degree simply illustrate attempts by artists to turn this obstacle to their advantage. Art-that’s-about-art has in turn spawned a whole school of art criticism built around the demonstrably true (but limited) premise that artists continually “re-define” art through their work. This approach treats “what art is” as a legitimate, serious and even thorny topic, but expends little energy on the question of “what art making is”.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>if there were some ongoing redefinition of “what chess is”, you’d probably feel a little uneasy trying to play chess.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>while you may feel you’re just pretending that you’re an artist, there’s no way to pretend you’re making art.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Your work may not be what curators want to exhibit or publishers want to publish, but those are different issues entirely.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>You make good work by (among other things) making lots of work that isn’t very good, and gradually weeding out the parts that aren’t good, the parts that aren’t yours. It’s called feedback, and it’s the most direct route to learning about your own vision.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Examples of genius only accentuate that truth. Newspapers love to print stories about five-year-old musical prodigies giving solo recitals, but you rarely read about one going on to become a Mozart.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you think good work is somehow synonymous with perfect work, you are headed for big trouble. Art is human; error is human; ergo, art is error. Inevitably, your work (like, uh, the preceding syllogism...) will be flawed.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Annihilation is an existential fear: the common — but sharply overdrawn — fear that some part of you dies when you stop making art. And it’s true. Non-artists may not understand that, but artists themselves (especially those who are stuck) understand it all too well. The depth of your need to make things establishes the level of risk in not making them.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The place to learn about your execution is in your execution.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Put simply, your work is your guide: a complete, comprehensive, limitless reference book on your work.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Your work tells you about your working methods, your discipline, your strengths and weaknesses, your habitual gestures, your willingness to embrace. The lessons you are meant to learn are in your work. To see them, you need only look at the work clearly — without judgement, without need or fear, without wishes or hopes.</p>
