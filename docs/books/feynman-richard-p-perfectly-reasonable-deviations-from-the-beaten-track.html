         <div class="meta">Feynman, Richard P.</div>

<article>
    <p>When a Caltech student asked the eminent cosmologist Michael Turner what his “bias” was in favoring one or another particle as a likely candidate to comprise the dark matter in the universe, Feynman snapped, “Why do you want to know his bias? Form your own bias!”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“I can live with doubt and uncertainty,” he said. “I think it’s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He once defined science as belief in the ignorance of experts.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>now I’m hitting some mathematical difficulties which I will either surmount, walk around, or go a different way—all of which consumes all my time—but I like to do very much and am very happy indeed.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I received your prune things during these times. Since I was not gastronomically on top of the world I have avoided eating them.When I get a little better inside and my intestines become more attuned to their responsibilities instead of taking their devil-may-care attitude, I’ll eat them (the prunes I mean).</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>So, of course, I had to make pine needle tea. I did while visiting Putzie Sunday, not that either of us were short on Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) but my curiosity was aroused. Result—fair. Not too wonderful, not too bad. About as good as regular tea, but different. Crush the pine needles up—pour on boiling water and allow to steep a while. Serve hot, or with ice and lemon. Cheap. Remarkable fact is it tastes like pine needles.</p>

    <p>She is gaining weight—not however, uniformly, but about 1# or 1 1/2 a week on the average—some weeks none—others 2, etc.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I took a shower this morning (I went to bed 11:30 and woke up 9 or 10 and lazed around).The shower has tin walls so I had a wonderful time making noise.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There was another fellow there too—so this guy played the UKE while the husband played the clarinet and I banged on the furniture, etc. with various objects.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I am writing this Tuesday Morning. I love you Tuesday Morning. But that is just a symptom of a far more extensive ailment. I love you always.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>woman.You are not always as strong as other times but it rises and falls like the flow of a mountain stream. I feel I am a reservoir for your strength—without you I would be empty and weak like I was before I knew you—but your moments of strength make me strong and thus I am able to comfort you with your own strength when your stream is low.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Julius borrowed my clock so I don’t know exactly what time it is, but is before 12 I think.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>morning.The last time I shaved was when I was in Albuquerque—Sunday night. Five days. I’d just as soon quit shaving altogether, but you look so damn dopey and it isn’t too comfortable (I mean, I look so damn dopey—you look dopey whether I shave or not—I love you).</p>
    <hr class="chill" />

    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I’d just as soon work only on cheap watches—but I suppose I’ll get an expensive one someday. Perhaps I better practice on my good watch which is in a hell of a state because I fooled around with it so much. I just got it out to look at it. It seems to be OK except that the minute hand is missing. It works OK otherwise tho.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>He wrote that at the top so you wouldn’t get a nervous breakdown and figure he was in love with you, when I write: I love you. Because I do love you and my name is not Julius (or Nick) (which reminds me the baby better not be born with a mustache, or I’ll know who!) but Richard, your loving husband.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I got drunker than I ever did before too. I didn’t even think I could act sober if I wanted to—I was making a lot of noise (they got me my drum), etc. I don’t like it because I know I didn’t drum good or make good jokes and I wasn’t all there to appreciate other people’s jokes</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It sounds like a lot of fun but I know I would have enjoyed it better were I more sober.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I guess every guy has to get pretty drunk once in his life in order to be sure he doesn’t like drink. Same with smoking, after cigarettes, pipe and cigars I gave the whole thing up. I’m getting moraller and moraller as I get older—that’s bad.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I didn’t tell you about my trip back here Sunday night. Everything was OK until we got to Española—and there I saw a Ferris wheel and lights and stuff of a carnival so I got out of the bus right there and gave no further thought to how I was going to get back up the hill.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The car had three girls in it. But they were kind of ugly so I remained faithful without even having the fun of exerting will power to do it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>No man is rich who is unsatisfied, but who wants nothing possess his heart’s desire.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I am willing to proceed in any way that seems to you to be in the best interests of the country, even if it should mean some personal danger. Sincerely, R. P. Feynman</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I should like to emphasize again that I would like to cooperate fully with the Department. I would be perfectly satisfied with a refusal of permission to go, without feeling that any rights were violated. The situation between the countries is delicate and I am sure that you are far better at judging the repercussions of such a move than am I. On the other hand, if there are no objections I would like to go to the conference.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Does it strike you that prompt replies to requests for their State Department’s views might make it easier for citizens to act in such a way as to protect the department from unnecessary embarrassment? Sincerely, Richard P. Feynman</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Dear Mr. Bown: Thank you for your formidable letter describing the legal interrelations. Who is the “designee”? Is that me or am I an advisor, or what the hell? Put it in plain clear one-syllable words, please.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I have a vague recollection of being short or impatient with you somewhere in the past. At least that is how I have become toward the newspaper science press generally. I apologize; to you, but not to the others.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you are an average student in everything and no intellectual pursuit gives you real delight, then I don’t know how to advise you.You will have to discuss it with someone else. It is a problem that I have not thought about very hard.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>This is not an excuse but an admission of irresponsibility.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I am sorry, but I shall not have time to write the article you want for the Bethe volume.You make me feel uncomfortable—I like Hans so very much that I feel I “ought” to do what you want—but who invented this infernal idea of writing an article for a guy when he gets to be 60? Isn’t there an easier way to show friendship and regard? I feel like I feel on “Mother’s Day.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Congratulations on your Nobel award. In an age of “publish or perish” it has been my pleasure to have come into contact with a good physicist who was also a good teacher.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>MARTIN B. EINHORN TO RICHARD</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>MARTIN B. EINHORN TO RICHARD P. FEYNMAN, OCTOBER 23, 1965</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Secondly that the entire article was clear, comprehensible, well-written and accurate can only be explained by a complete disregard of professional standards in these matters. For example, I was not able to find, attributed to me, a single quotation of anything that I did not say myself.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Incidentally, we would all like to felicitate you personally on one of your trips east.Your accomplishments make us all feel that teaching has been worthwhile even though we all realize that you would have accomplished what you did regardless of any teacher.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I have a great deal to thank you for in aiming me and educating me in the direction of physics. I did not remember the time I asked you about the advisability of taking courses in education but I see that you supplied me with not only a good education but good advice.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>To see generosity you must be generous enough not to see the meanness, and to see just meanness in a man you must be mean enough not to see the generosity.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I know how you hate notoriety, so my sympathies are with you on this sad occasion. Those Nobel people are no respecters of the scientists’ rights to pretend they are not great copy.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>What hurts worse is to think of myself in tails receiving something from the King of Sweden, while the television cameras are watching. It would be all right if they would just give you the prize, but to make you go through the ringer to get it is a dirty trick.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>You say you are a nameless man.You are not to your wife and to your child.You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office.You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself—it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of the naïve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s ideals are. Best of luck and happiness.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>One gets the impression then that science is to be a set of pat formulas to standard questions. “What makes it move,” quickly all hands are eagerly raised, the lesson is learned, they are to say “Energy makes it move,” “Gravity makes it fall,” “The soles of our shoes wear out because of friction.” Just words, nothing is explained. It is like just saying “Because of God’s will” and having nothing left to look into.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you knew me well, you would know that I am immodest enough to take all compliments at their face value and not to think that they might be idle flattering.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>But what do we do with a textbook which (unlike most of the others) says mathematics is useful in the sciences and then gives the example: “Red stars have a temperature of 8000 degrees, Blue stars, 12000 degrees. John sees three blue stars and one red star.What is the total temperature of the stars John sees?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I shall write you some of my ruminations, not that you have not already thought of them, and that I am telling you anything new, but rather as a continuing informal conversation to see how well I am learning my lessons.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Naturally, I am very pleased and flattered that you thought them worth translating to German. But, it means even more to me that you found the thought of some relevance to you in the face of your father’s death.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>My doctor forbids me to serve as a consulting editor because it is bad for my blood pressure. I end up wanting to write the book and am frustrated by the actual author.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I feel unhappy that I am not sure enough of my position to be able to sign your letter. As next best alternative I am enclosing a small check to help to make sure your advertisement is published.</p>
