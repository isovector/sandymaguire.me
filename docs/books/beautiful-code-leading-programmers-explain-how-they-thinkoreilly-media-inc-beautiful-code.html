    <p>Binary search has some very large advantages. First of all, its performance is O(log2 N). People often don&#39;t really grasp how powerful this is. On a 32-bit computer, the biggest log2 you&#39;ll ever encounter is 32

    <p>Some look at my binary-search algorithm and ask why the loop always runs to the end without checking whether it&#39;s found the target. In fact, this is the correct behavior; the math is beyond the scope of this chapter, but with a little work, you should be able to get an intuitive feeling for it—and this is the kind of intuition I&#39;ve observed in some of the great programmers I&#39;ve worked with.
Let&#39;s think about the progress of the loop. Suppose you have n elements in the array, where n is some really large number. The chance of finding the target the first time through is 1/n, a really small number. The next iteration (after you divide the search set in half) is 1/(n/2)—still small—and so on. In fact, the chance of hitting the target becomes significant only when you&#39;re down to 10 or 20 elements, which is to say maybe the last four times through the loop.

    <p>If there&#39;s a moral to this story, it is this: do not let performance considerations stop you from doing what is right. You can always make the code faster with a little cleverness. You can rarely recover so easily from a bad design

    <p>Part of the reason that young software engineers should cut their teeth debugging complicated systems is that it inculcates a lifelong skill: the ability to analyze a solution to a problem in terms of the ways that it won&#39;t work instead of the ways that it might—the ability to focus on the edge conditions. When conceiving of new software, we software engineers should not try to convince ourselves why our design will work; we should invalidate the reasons why it will not.

    <p>It is therefore good library design to export STM actions (rather than IO actions) whenever possible, because they are composable; their type advertises that they have no irrevocable effects. The library client can readily get from STM to IO (using atomically), but not vice versa.

    <p>There are places where it could be more bookish, or where code could blend in more, for example. Sure, we&#39;d like to clean those up, but while we like pretty code, we like clean merges even better. Changes to variable names, whitespace, line breaks, and so forth can be more of an obstacle to merging than logic changes.
