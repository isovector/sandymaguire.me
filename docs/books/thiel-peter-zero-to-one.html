    <p>EVERY MOMENT IN BUSINESS happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Unless they invest in the difficult task of creating new things, American companies will fail in the future no matter how big their profits remain today.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Today’s “best practices” lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. We call these miracles technology.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Humans don’t decide what to build by making choices from some cosmic catalog of options given in advance; instead, by creating new technologies, we rewrite the plan of the world. These are the kind of elementary truths we teach to second graders, but they are easy to forget in a world where so much of what we do is repeat what has been done before.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>College students can become extremely skilled at a few specialties, but many never learn what to do with those skills in the wider world.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There’s no reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon Valley.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>if nothing about our society changes for the next 100 years, then the future is over 100 years away.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Most answers to the contrarian question are different ways of seeing the present; good answers are as close as we can come to looking into the future.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>At the macro level, the single word for horizontal progress is globalization—taking things that work somewhere and making them work everywhere.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The single word for vertical, 0 to 1 progress is technology. The rapid progress of information technology in recent decades has made Silicon Valley the capital of “technology” in general. But there is no reason why technology should be limited to computers. Properly understood, any new and better way of doing things is technology.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>our everyday language suggests we believe in a kind of technological end of history: the division of the world into the so-called developed and developing nations implies that the “developed” world has already achieved the achievable, and that poorer nations just need to catch up.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Spreading old ways to create wealth around the world will result in devastation, not riches. In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The smartphones that distract us from our surroundings also distract us from the fact that our surroundings are strangely old: only computers and communications have improved dramatically since midcentury</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>New technology tends to come from new ventures—startups. From the Founding Fathers in politics to the Royal Society in science to Fairchild Semiconductor’s “traitorous eight” in business, small groups of people bound together by a sense of mission have changed the world for the better.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The easiest explanation for this is negative: it’s hard to develop new things in big organizations, and it’s even harder to do it by yourself. Bureaucratic hierarchies move slowly, and entrenched interests shy away from risk.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if this describes your company, you should quit now).</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>extreme, a lone genius might create a classic work of art or literature, but he could never create an entire industry.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A new company’s most important strength is new thinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>whatever the cultural fascination with Nirvana, grunge, and heroin reflected, it wasn’t hope or confidence.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The era of cornucopian hope was relabeled as an era of crazed greed and declared to be definitely over.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Everyone learned to treat the future as fundamentally indefinite, and to dismiss as an extremist anyone with plans big enough to be measured in years instead of quarters.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Grand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged. Anyone who claims to be able to do something great is suspect, and anyone who wants to change the world should be more humble. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>All companies must be “lean,” which is code for “unplanned.” You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead you should try things out, “iterate,” and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Don’t try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the opposite principles are probably more correct:</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality. 2. A bad plan is better than no plan. 3. Competitive markets destroy profits. 4. Sales matters just as much as product.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It’s true that there was a bubble in technology. The late ’90s was a time of hubris: people believed in going from 0 to 1. Too few startups were actually getting there, and many never went beyond talking about it. But people understood that we had no choice but to find ways to do more with less. The market high of March 2000 was obviously a peak of insanity; less obvious but more important, it was also a peak of clarity. People looked far into the future, saw how much valuable new technology we would need to get there safely, and judged themselves capable of creating it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>THE BUSINESS VERSION of our contrarian question is: what valuable company is nobody building?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Creating value is not enough—you also need to capture some of the value you create.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In this book, we’re not interested in illegal bullies or government favorites: by “monopoly,” we mean the kind of company that’s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute. Google is a good example of a company that went from 0 to 1: it hasn’t competed in search since the early 2000s, when it definitively distanced itself from Microsoft and Yahoo!</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Americans mythologize competition and credit it with saving us from socialist bread lines. Actually, capitalism and competition are opposites. Capitalism is premised on the accumulation of capital, but under perfect competition all profits get competed away. The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: if you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Framing itself as just another tech company allows Google to escape all sorts of unwanted attention.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Non-monopolists tell the opposite lie: “we’re in a league of our own.” Entrepreneurs are always biased to understate the scale of competition, but that is the biggest mistake a startup can make. The fatal temptation is to describe your market extremely narrowly so that you dominate it by definition.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>When you hear that most new restaurants fail within one or two years, your instinct will be to come up with a story about how yours is different. You’ll spend time trying to convince people that you are exceptional instead of seriously considering whether that’s true. It would be better to pause and consider whether there are people in Palo Alto who would rather eat British food above all else. It’s very possible they don’t exist.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>We had our pick of restaurants, starting with obvious categories like Indian, sushi, and burgers. There were more options once we settled on a type: North Indian or South Indian, cheaper or fancier, and so on. In contrast to the competitive local restaurant market, PayPal was at that time the only email-based payments company in the world.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Starting a new South Indian restaurant is a really hard way to make money. If you lose sight of competitive reality and focus on trivial differentiating factors—maybe you think your naan is superior because of your great-grandmother’s recipe—your business is unlikely to survive.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Suppose her idea is to have Jay-Z star in a cross between Hackers and Jaws: rap star joins elite group of hackers to catch the shark that killed his friend. That has definitely never been done before. But, like the lack of British restaurants in Palo Alto, maybe that’s a good thing.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various smaller markets: British food ∩ restaurant ∩ Palo Alto Rap star ∩ hackers ∩ sharks Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the union of several large markets: search engine ∪ mobile phones ∪ wearable computers ∪ self-driving cars</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can’t.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In perfect competition, a business is so focused on today’s margins that it can’t possibly plan for a long-term future.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Creative monopolies aren’t just good for the rest of society; they’re powerful engines for making it better.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the government knows this: that’s why one of its departments works hard to create monopolies (by granting patents to new inventions) even though another part hunts them down (by prosecuting antitrust cases).</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate. Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can’t dream of.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>So why are economists obsessed with competition as an ideal state? It’s a relic of history. Economists copied their mathematics from the work of 19th-century physicists: they see individuals and businesses as interchangeable atoms, not as unique creators.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Their theories describe an equilibrium state of perfect competition</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Their theories describe an equilibrium state of perfect competition because that’s what’s easy to model, not because it represents the best of business.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Whatever your views on thermodynamics, it’s a powerful metaphor:</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Tolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: “All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Business is the opposite. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>why do people believe that competition is healthy? The answer is that competition is not just an economic concept or a simple inconvenience that individuals and companies must deal with in the marketplace. More than anything else, competition is an ideology—the ideology—that pervades our society and distorts our thinking. We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it—even though the more we compete, the less we gain.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>This is a simple truth, but we’ve all been trained to ignore it. Our educational system both drives and reflects our obsession with competition. Grades themselves allow precise measurement of each student’s competitiveness; pupils with the highest marks receive status and credentials. We teach every young person the same subjects in mostly the same ways, irrespective of individual talents and preferences. Students who don’t learn best by sitting still at a desk are made to feel somehow inferior, while children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up defining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>For the privilege of being turned into conformists, students (or their families) pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in skyrocketing tuition that continues to outpace inflation. Why are we doing this to ourselves?</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The highest prize in a law student’s world is unambiguous: out of tens of thousands of graduates each year, only a few dozen get a Supreme Court clerkship. After clerking on a federal appeals court for a year, I was invited to interview for clerkships with Justices Kennedy and Scalia. My meetings with the Justices went well. I was so close to winning this last competition. If only I got the clerkship, I thought, I would be set for life. But I didn’t. At the time, I was devastated</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>an old friend from law school who had helped me prepare my failed clerkship applications. We hadn’t spoken in nearly a decade. His first question wasn’t “How are you doing?” or “Can you believe it’s been so long?” Instead, he grinned and asked: “So, Peter, aren’t you glad you didn’t get that clerkship?”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Had I actually clerked on the Supreme Court, I probably would have spent my entire career taking depositions or drafting other people’s business deals instead of creating anything new. It’s hard to say how much would be different, but the opportunity costs were enormous. All Rhodes Scholars had a great future in their past.</p>

    <p>To Shakespeare, by contrast, all combatants look more or less alike. It’s not at all clear why they should be fighting, since they have nothing to fight about. Consider the opening line from Romeo and Juliet: “Two households, both alike in dignity.” The two houses are alike, yet they hate each other. They grow even more similar as the feud escalates. Eventually, they lose sight of why they started fighting in the first place. In the world of business, at least, Shakespeare proves the superior guide. Inside a firm, people become obsessed with their competitors for career advancement. Then the firms themselves become obsessed with their competitors in the marketplace. Amid all the human drama, people lose sight of what matters and focus on their rivals instead.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The hazards of imitative competition may partially explain why individuals with an Asperger’s-like social ineptitude seem to be at an advantage in Silicon Valley today. If you’re less sensitive to social cues, you’re less likely to do the same things as everyone else around you. If you’re interested in making things or programming computers, you’ll be less afraid to pursue those activities single-mindedly and thereby become incredibly good at them. Then when you apply your skills, you’re a little less likely than others to give up your own convictions: this can save you from getting caught up in crowds competing for obvious prizes.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Amid all the tactical questions—Who could price chewy dog toys most aggressively? Who could create the best Super Bowl ads?—these companies totally lost sight of the wider question of whether the online pet supply market was the right space to be in.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn’t one worth fighting.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>By late 1999, we were in all-out war. Many of us at PayPal logged 100-hour workweeks. No doubt that was counterproductive, but the focus wasn’t on objective productivity; the focus was defeating X.com. One of our engineers actually designed a bomb for this purpose; when he presented the schematic at a team meeting, calmer heads prevailed and the proposal was attributed to extreme sleep deprivation.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Sometimes you do have to fight. Where that’s true, you should fight and win. There is no middle ground: either don’t throw any punches, or strike hard and end it quickly.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Simply stated, the value of a business today is the sum of all the money it will make in the future.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Nightclubs or restaurants are extreme examples: successful ones might collect healthy amounts today, but their cash flows will probably dwindle over the next few years when customers move on to newer and trendier alternatives.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Most of a tech company’s value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the future.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you focus on near-term growth above all else, you miss the most important question you should be asking: will this business still be around a decade from now? Numbers alone won’t tell you the answer; instead you must think critically about the qualitative characteristics of your business.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Proprietary technology is the most substantive advantage a company can have because it makes your product difficult or impossible to replicate. Google’s search algorithms, for example, return results better than anyone else’s. Proprietary technologies for extremely short page load times and highly accurate query autocompletion add to the core search product’s robustness and defensibility. It would be very hard for anyone to do to Google what Google did to all the other search engine companies in the early 2000s.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite. A drug to safely eliminate the need for sleep, or a cure for baldness,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The clearest way to make a 10x improvement is to invent something completely new. If you build something valuable where there was nothing before, the increase in value is theoretically infinite. A drug to safely eliminate the need for sleep, or a cure for baldness, for example, would certainly support a monopoly business.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Network effects can be powerful, but you’ll never reap them unless your product is valuable to its very first users when the network is necessarily small.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Paradoxically, then, network effects businesses must start with especially small markets. Facebook started with just Harvard students—Mark Zuckerberg’s first product was designed to get all his classmates signed up, not to attract all people of Earth. This is why successful network businesses rarely get started by MBA types: the initial markets are so small that they often don’t even appear to be business opportunities at all.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Many businesses gain only limited advantages as they grow to large scale. Service businesses especially are difficult to make monopolies. If you own a yoga studio, for example, you’ll only be able to serve a certain number of customers. You can hire more instructors and expand to more locations, but your margins will remain fairly low and you’ll never reach a point where a core group of talented people can provide something of value to millions of separate clients, as software engineers are able to do.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous. Ever since Marissa Mayer became CEO of Yahoo! in mid-2012, she has worked to revive the once-popular internet giant by making it cool again. In a single tweet, Yahoo! summarized Mayer’s plan as a chain reaction of “people then products then traffic then revenue.” The people are supposed to come for the coolness: Yahoo! demonstrated design awareness by overhauling its logo, it asserted youthful relevance by acquiring hot startups like Tumblr, and it has gained media attention for Mayer’s own star power. But the big question is what products Yahoo! will actually create. When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, he didn’t just make Apple a cool place to work; he slashed product lines to focus on the handful of opportunities for 10x improvements. No technology company can be built on branding alone.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. Always err on the side of starting too small. The reason is simple: it’s easier to dominate a small market than a large one. If you think your initial market might be too big, it almost certainly is.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>we set our sights on eBay auctions, where we found our first success. In late 1999, eBay had a few thousand high-volume “PowerSellers,” and after only three months of dedicated effort, we were serving 25% of them. It was much easier to reach a few thousand people who really needed our product than to try to compete for the attention of millions of scattered individuals.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Sequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to expand gradually. The most successful companies make the core progression—to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets—a part of their founding narrative.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The concept was coined to describe threats to incumbent companies, so startups’ obsession with disruption means they see themselves through older firms’ eyes. If you think of yourself as an insurgent battling dark forces, it’s easy to become unduly fixated on the obstacles in your path. But if you truly want to make something new, the act of creation is far more important than the old industries that might not like what you create.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Hundreds of people have started multiple multimillion-dollar businesses. A few, like Steve Jobs, Jack Dorsey, and Elon Musk, have created several multibillion-dollar companies. If success were mostly a matter of luck, these kinds of serial entrepreneurs probably wouldn’t exist.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter and Square, tweeted to his 2 million followers: “Success is never accidental.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>‘Success is never accidental,’ said all multimillionaire white men.” It’s true that already successful people have an easier time doing new things, whether due to their networks, wealth, or experience. But perhaps we’ve become too quick to dismiss anyone who claims to have succeeded according to plan.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />

    <p>Ralph Waldo Emerson captured this ethos when he wrote: “Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances.… Strong men believe in cause and effect.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>No one pretended that misfortune didn’t exist, but prior generations believed in making their own luck by working hard.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>This is not what young people do today, because everyone around them has long since lost faith in a definite world. No one gets into Stanford by excelling at just one thing, unless that thing happens to involve throwing or catching a leather ball.</p>

    <p>From China’s viewpoint, economic growth cannot come fast enough. Every other country is afraid that China is going to take over the world; China is the only country afraid that it won’t.</p>

    <p>In the late 1940s, a Californian named John Reber set out to reinvent the physical geography of the whole San Francisco Bay Area. Reber was a schoolteacher, an amateur theater producer, and a self-taught engineer. Undaunted by his lack of credentials, he publicly proposed to build two huge dams in the Bay, construct massive freshwater lakes for drinking water and irrigation, and reclaim 20,000 acres of land for development. Even though he had no personal authority, people took the Reber Plan seriously. It was endorsed by newspaper editorial boards across California. The U.S. Congress held hearings on its feasibility. The Army Corps of Engineers even constructed a 1.5-acre scale model of the Bay in a cavernous Sausalito warehouse to simulate it. These tests revealed technical shortcomings, so the plan wasn’t executed. But would anybody today take such a vision seriously in the first place? In the 1950s, people welcomed big plans and asked whether they would work. Today a grand plan coming from a schoolteacher would be dismissed as crankery, and a long-range vision coming from anyone more powerful would be derided as hubris. You can still visit the Bay Model in that Sausalito warehouse, but today it’s just a tourist attraction: big plans for the future have become archaic curiosities.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In the 1950s, Americans thought big plans for the future were too important to be left to experts.</p>

    <p>To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn’t know how exactly, so he won’t make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely.</p>

    <p>Recent graduates’ parents often cheer them on the established path. The strange history of the Baby Boom produced a generation of indefinite optimists so used to effortless progress that they feel entitled to it. Whether you were born in 1945 or 1950 or 1955, things got better every year for the first 18 years of your life, and it had nothing to do with you.</p>

Every year of adulthood continued to get automatically better and better for the rich and successful. The rest of their generation was left behind, but the wealthy Boomers who shape public opinion today see little reason to question their naïve optimism. Since tracked careers worked for them, they can’t imagine that they won’t work for their kids, too.</p>

    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>they miss the even bigger social context for their own preferred explanations: a whole generation learned from childhood to overrate the power of chance and underrate the importance of planning.</p>
