    <p>the notebooks were more of a comfort object, which I mostly used for things I might need to refer to that were too important to leave to memory.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I wrote without dwelling on the words or trying to edit. If I decided that what came out of my brain was too terrible to be recorded, I could set the page on fire - after I had seen what was on it for myself.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>temerity</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>&quot;Alice,&quot; I said, talking over her, &quot;can I ask you something?&quot; Her eyes got very wide. She stared at me. She appeared to be desperately wondering if there was a polite way to say &quot;no, you may not&quot; and coming up blank. Finally she nodded once.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>&quot;I accept</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>&quot;I, um, register a general approval of knowing things rather than not, and of safety,&quot;</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Soonish. Incongruous sort of word to attach to the timing of my impending vampirization.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Yes, yes, shallowness ahoy, but it mattered more to be correct than to pretend myself deep.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The door opened, and in meandered Edward, looking oddly long-suffering. &quot;You are the most persuasive creature on Earth,&quot; he murmured.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There was no protocol in her memory for what to do when a vampire took her out for lobster.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>&quot;Fine by me,&quot; I said. &quot;What does Eleazar do?&quot; &quot;He&#39;s got a meta-power, like yours. He can tell what somebody does without having to ask them or watch them do it,&quot; explained Kate. &quot;Maybe he can tell us why Harry here thinks you&#39;re &quot;wrong&quot;.&quot;</p>
