<article>
    <p>People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do. —Isaac Asimov</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the pioneers of invention and of aviation in particular were quite as popular as the heroes of sport. For 1925, Google N-grams counts essentially the same number of mentions for the Wright brothers, Babe Ruth, and Thomas Edison.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>From Wells’ script: [3]  (The mob, by the by, is as well dressed as any other people in the film. It has the well-groomed look which is universal in the new world. It is not a social conflict we are witnessing. It is not the Haves attacked by the Have-nots; it is the Doers attacked by the Do-nots.)</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>La Cierva’s thought processes as he successfully solves the challenges of the autogyro, because he explains them in his very readable autobiography, Wings of Tomorrow.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>however, they have tended to have a high accident rate. Part of the reason is that today, most gyroplanes are homebuilt ultralights piloted (even designed!) by their builders without much training in the type.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Are we going to be stuck with the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit forevermore? Is this the fastest we will ever go? —Moulton Taylor</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The ConvAirCar very nearly succeeded. It was built by a major aircraft company (Convair). They had an ingenious marketing plan: they would sell you the car part, and have a chain of dealers at airports who would rent you the airplane part. When you bought the car part, you had a working car, whether you ever flew or not.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Imagine trying to build a mechanical clock that had to be accurate to a second a day, small and light enough to carry in a suitcase, but which would have railroad cars attached as the hour and minute hands. So the rotor hub is not only expensive to manufacture, but for safety must have constant maintenance by well-trained, intelligent, and motivated—read expensive—technicians.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The Leave It to Beaver family of the 50s had a life that was essentially as comfortable as ours is today, but worlds removed from that of the turn of the 20th century. Improvements since then, as seen by the average person, have consisted in remarkably large part of decoration or entertainment.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I am, and ever will be, a white socks, pocket protector, nerdy engineer. And I take a substantial amount of pride in the accomplishments of my profession. —Neil Armstrong</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Medical care now costs six times as much as in the 60s: in 1960, the average worker worked ten days to pay for his health insurance; today, 60 days.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>College tuition and textbooks cost in the neighborhood of ten times as much. Subways used to cost $5 million a mile; now, in New York anyway, $3 billion a mile.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In the Seventies, actual economic growth fell below a constant-growth trend line and never regained it. We went into a secular decline that has us further from the curve now (in dollar terms) than we were in the depths of the Great Depression itself.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>We could have predicted over the last few years what the American government’s policies on oil and natural gas would be if we had assumed that the aim of the American government was to increase the power and income of the OPEC countries and to reduce the standard of living in the United States. —(Economics Nobel laureate) Ronald Coase</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It is perfectly feasible to build GEMs that big; their efficiency improves with size. Furthermore they would not only have been faster across the oceans, but they wouldn’t need canals or docks—they could proceed across any reasonably level ground (or ice). This could have changed the face of worldwide shipping as much as containerization. But the GEM uses more power than a boat.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In 1973, the FAA banned civilian supersonic flight over the United States. The ostensible reason was noise, although the activists responsible for the push enormously exaggerated it. One of the major avenues of technological improvement we rightly expected in the 1960s was faster airliners. 40 years of advancement in aeronautics would let us field supersonic airliners that were much quieter today; but the ban remains, in a classic Catch-22 where there are no actual sonic boom noise standards, but the FAA wants to see the airplane first and then they’ll decide on the rule. In this case, we got the double whammy of energy starvation and regulatory strangulation.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Engines of Creation,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Solvay conferences of the 1930s that were so iconic in the development</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things; because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the member of a mature scientific community is, like the typical character of Orwell’s 1984, the victim of a history rewritten by the powers that be.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A recent paper quotes the great cognitive psychologist George Miller on how hard it was to break the stranglehold of behaviorism on psychology: [41]  The power, the honors, the authority, the textbooks, the money, everything in psychology was owned by the behavioristic school . . . those of us who wanted to be scientific psychologists couldn’t really oppose it. You just wouldn’t get a job.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I discovered, to my amazement, that all through history there had been resistance— and bitter, exaggerated, last-ditch resistance— to every significant technological change that had taken place on earth. Usually the resistance came from those groups who stood to lose influence, status, money as a result of the change. Although they never advanced this as their reason for resisting it. It was always the good of humanity that rested upon their hearts. —Isaac Asimov</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Failures of the Imagination are much harder to spot, except in retrospect. All one can do is to stack one’s own imagination up against the experts’, always a perilous proposition. But we can still reasonably call it a failure because we must always keep in mind that there are things we don’t know.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>One of the great tragedies of the latter Twentieth Century, and clearly one of the causes of the Great Stagnation, was the increasing centralization and bureaucratization of science and research funding. This meant that Failures of Nerve and Imagination, which are particularly strong among bureaucrats, instead of merely causing incorrect predictions from pundits, caused resource starvation and active suppression, and became self-fulfilling prophecies.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>roughly 60 times as many scientific papers have been published since 1962 as were published in all the time before.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>it may well be that ivory tower syndrome both enhances apparent scientific discovery and impedes useful application.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Cold fusion would have been a major embarrassment to high-energy physics. They would have lost not only funding, which in the zero-sum nature of science funding would have gone to cold fusion research, but to some extent the cachet of being the smartest kid on the block in science.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>look at the impact the highway system did have. It’s estimated to have been responsible for something like a third of all economic growth in the booming, optimistic Fifties. The Interstate system alone is estimated [75]  over the latter half of the twentieth century to have added about a trillion (1996) dollars to the economy, building up from nothing when construction started in 1956.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you want to start an automobile company in this country you need a handful of engineers—and at least 1000 lawyers. —Arnold Kling</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The number of pages in the Federal Register increased by 121 percent under Nixon.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Today, the federal regulatory code is over 175,000 pages long.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It’s not about flying. It’s not about aircraft. It’s not about maintenance of aircraft. It’s not about who is qualified to do maintenance. It’s an addendum, with three separate references back into the regulatory corpus, to the rules regarding who is allowed to do paperwork about maintenance.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Economists John Dawson and John Seater recently published a study in the Journal of Economic Growth, “Federal Regulation and Aggregate Economic Growth”,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Note that these studies explicitly avoid any consideration of the positive benefits the regulation might have—they are entirely an exercise in calculating the costs. However, it’s hard to imagine that regulation has produced so much value that the average American family would readily pay $132,000 a year for it!</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It is commonly believed that regulation of things like medicine and cars is necessary to ensure safety. But life expectancy in the US rose from 47.3 to 68.2 in the first half of the 20th century, an increase of over 30 percent; but in the latter half, the age of regulation, only from 68.2 to 76.8, just 11 percent.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The US government itself estimates that the total cost of regulation in the US is nearing two trillion a year—$1.75 trillion in 2008. [88]  The direct costs were $15,586 per household per year. This is considerably higher than it has been over the course of the Great Stagnation, and again it ignores benefits. It is easy to believe a two percent reduction going back to the Sixties. But by now it appears to be over ten percent of the economy.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The 1931 crash of TWA flight 599, in which Knute Rockne died, was the same kind of widely publicized disaster that sparked an outcry and gave impetus to the regulatory machinery. (Even though, as in the case of Elixir Sulfanilamide, it was private professionals who actually found and fixed the problems.)</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There has grown up in the minds of certain groups in this country the notion that because a man or corporation has made a profit out of the public for a number of years, the government and the courts are charged with the duty of guaranteeing such profit in the future, even in the face of changing circumstances and contrary public interest. —Robert A. Heinlein,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Last year Congress passed 138 laws; agencies published 2,926 new regulations. Federal courts handled about 95,000 cases; regulatory administrative courts a million.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>But the result was that the ruling has generally been interpreted as saying that regulators can do anything they want unless it is specifically prohibited in the enabling legislation. If a regulator charges you with a transgression, e.g. OSHA finds that your stair railings are 40 inches high instead of 42, even though there has never been any accident involving them, or that you have bags of ordinary beach sand that are not labelled “Poison,” [94]  you don’t get to challenge it in a real court; you must plead your case in the regulator’s own “administrative court.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Because of the all-encompassing breadth and specificity of the regulations and the clueless literality with which they are enforced, it is essentially impossible to run a productive business without breaking some of them. This leaves the individual agents with a free hand to say who they will shut down and who they won’t—a government of men and not of laws.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The world of antitrust is reminiscent of Alice’s Wonderland: everything seemingly is, yet apparently isn’t, simultaneously. It is a world in which competition is lauded as the basic axiom and guiding principle, yet &quot;too much&quot; competition is condemned as &quot;cutthroat.&quot; It is a world in which actions designed to limit competition are branded as criminal when taken by businessmen, yet praised as &quot;enlightened&quot; when initiated by the government. It is a world in which the law is so vague that businessmen have no way of knowing whether specific actions will be declared illegal until they hear the judge’s verdict — after the fact. —Alan Greenspan</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Until the 1980s, property and liability insurance was a small cost of doing business. But the substantial expansion in what legally constitutes liability has greatly increased the cost of liability insurance for personal injuries.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the cost of the U.S. tort system consumes about two percent of GDP, on average. If we assume this mostly started around 1980 when lawyers skyrocketed and the airplane industry was destroyed, the long-run compound-interest effect on the economy as a whole is startling: without it our economy today would be twice the size it actually is.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the effect of taking more than a million of the country’s most talented and motivated people and put them to work making arguments and filing briefs, against each other so their efforts mostly cancel out, instead of inventing, developing, and manufacturing things which could have made life better.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In any bureaucracy, the people devoted to the benefit of the bureaucracy itself always get in control and those dedicated to the goals the bureaucracy is supposed to accomplish have less and less influence, and sometimes are eliminated entirely. —Jerry Pournelle’s Iron Law of Bureaucracy</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The FAA, as a general stance and not just with drones, has a deep allergy to people making money with flying machines.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Amazon, the online marketer, famously proposed to use drones to deliver packages. Not only was this use illegal; the FAA wouldn’t even let them experiment with drones, and they had to go to Canada to do research and development.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I cannot help fearing that men may reach a point where they look on every new theory as a danger, every innovation as a toilsome trouble, every social advance as a first step toward revolution, and that they may absolutely refuse to move at all for fear of being carried off their feet.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>come to think, it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security sets a premium on feebleness</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>For such a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. ... This has ever been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor and decay.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>What was necessary for the flowering of any one of the revolutions was that sufficient people in society had moved up the Maslow hierarchy to the point where esteem and self-actualization became their major concerns, and virtue signalling became more important than real-world results.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>War ran out of steam as an effective selection mechanism around mid-20th century. Beginning with Korea, the battles were proxies done at arm’s length; the UN forces could (and did) bomb all the industry in North Korea to rubble, but it made no difference since the arms and materiel were coming from the USSR and China. The western world more or less froze the patterns of who was allowed to use what physical force upon whom in place. Then, paradoxically, competence in physical science and engineering was no longer the major factor in political power it had been in the previous centuries.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>there is a pattern that we see recurring throughout history, when a successful empire expands its borders so far that it becomes the biggest kid on the block. When survival is no longer at stake, selfish elites and other special interest groups capture the political agenda. The spirit that “we are all in the same boat” disappears and is replaced by a “winner take all” mentality.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Unfortunately, the impulse of the Progressive Era reformers, following the visions of Wells (and others) of a “Scientific Socialism,” was to centralize and unify, because that led to visible forms of efficiency. They didn’t realize that the competition they decried as inefficient, whether between firms or states, was the discovery procedure, the dynamic of evolution, the genetic algorithm that is the actual mainspring of innovation and progress.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The more or less individualistic and self-reliant culture of the 19th century had been winding down as the frontier filled up, but it gave way with a bang as Americans arose “in their righteous might” to prosecute the war—under a completely centralized bureaucratic government structure. This was not only the military but civilian production planning on an unprecedented scale. We came into the Postwar World with the belief that such a structure worked, as it had not only won the war but left the US the pre-eminent industrial power in the world.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the power to see ourselves as others see us is missing, but is often compensated for by an ability to get others to see us as we see ourselves!</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>But by the end of the Sixties, that had largely disappeared: people quit building backyard fallout shelters, schools quit holding air-raid drills, and so forth. But if people’s risk perception level is resistant to change, there are other ways than reckless driving to increase it. One obvious way is simply to start believing scare stories, from Corvairs to DDT to nuclear power to climate change. In other words, the Aquarian Eloi became phobic about everything specifically because we were actually safer, and needed something to worry about.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The Green religion has essentially superceded Christianity as the default religion of western civilization, especially in academic circles. Since the sixties it has developed into an apocalyptic nature cult, centered around climate change. Green ideas have become inextricably intertwined with a perfectly reasonable desire to live in a clean, healthy environment and enjoy the natural world.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The vast majority of the Eloi Agonistes who “believe in climate change” are not scientists who know anything about the enormously complex Earth climate system. They believe what they do because they have been told it by authority figures; they attach a moral significance to their beliefs; they believe that they are better people because they believe it. Belief in a human-caused climate apocalypse is a shibboleth in intellectual society. They react to skepticism not with careful self-searching reconsideration, but with the scathing inquisitions of heretic-hunters. This is a recipe for religious faith, not scientific knowledge.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I believe future historians will judge this irrational hatred of nuclear energy as the single greatest reason why greens lost the climate debate. The obvious contradiction between green claims that we face an existential climate crisis and their vehement opposition to nuclear power is what led me and I suspect many other skeptics to question their claims. —Eric Worrall</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The main result of our burgeoning ergophobia was that a lot of inventiveness and engineering resources got shifted from doing new things, and doing things better, to doing the same old things, usually not as well, but using less energy</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Eric Hoffer had noted that “Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>When Greenpeace turned anti-science by campaigning against chlorine (imagine the sheer stupidity of campaigning against one of the elements in the periodic table), I decided that it had lost its purpose and that, having achieved its original objectives, had turned to extremism to try to justify its continued existence.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>the diversion of so many of the most talented and motivated members of the last several generations from productive pursuits to expensive virtue signaling is one of the main causes of the technological slowdown and the Great Stagnation.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The Xhosa meme plague is clearly something of a dramatic outlier in the history of religious fervor run amok. But it stands as a stark reminder that when social feedback, superstition, hopes and desires, and the suppression of doubt and skepticism (“faith”) line up, the resulting movement can make an entire people believe and do horribly self-destructive things, completely at odds with common sense, which would be clearly insane in an individual.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A society in which everyone believes in a god who “knows if you’ve been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake!” is one in which people are more to be trusted, more likely to cooperate, more likely to trade instead of fight. Norenzayan backs up this hypothesis with an impressive array of experimental and historical research. In a civilization where belief in a Big God is effectively universal, there is a major advantage in the kind of things you can do collectively. In today’s America, you can’t be trusted to ride on an airliner with a nail file. How could you be trusted driving your own 1000-horsepower flying car?</p>

    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In popular culture, the basis of morality had shifted from lifelong training by precept and example in the hard-won knowlege of your forefathers, to whatever feels right. The latter is far more susceptible to self-deception and virtue signalling.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is a way of thinking. I have a foreboding of an America in my children’s or grandchildren’s time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what’s true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The idea that everyman could have an automobile—having of course to drive it himself, with the concomitant implication that the roads would be filled with amateur drivers—is simply missing. This was a notion farther from the mind of the fin de siecle intellectual than time machines or invaders from Mars.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There’s plenty of cheap land out there, 25,000 times cheaper than land in Manhattan, and up until the Stagnation people were making more and more use of it. The trend has stopped, if not reversed. The national investment in transportation infrastructure peaked in the Sixties:</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In 1974, cars were required to have an ignition interlock that prevented them from starting unless the seatbelts were fastened. (The national 55-mph speed limit was also a 1974 innovation.)</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In the 20th century, tumbling transport costs weakened the gravitational pull of the city; in the 21st, the digital revolution has restored it. Knowledge-intensive industries such as technology and finance thrive on the clustering of workers who share ideas and expertise. The economies and populations of metropolises like London, New York and San Francisco have rebounded as a result.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>As the Duke and Mr. Wells point out, this isn’t something particularly new. Travel at will was a prerogative of the aristocracy or the new political elite. The question, among others, that we started out to ask was why we don’t have flying cars by now. The obvious answers, such as that they were technologically infeasible, or even that they would be too expensive, turned out not to be right. Instead, perhaps the really fascinating question turns out to be why we ever got the family car in the first place.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Virtually every time I bring up the subject of flying cars to an acquaintance, I get much the same reaction. After an initial giggle and and reference to the Jetsons, people opine that they could never become the common mode of travel because the average person who drives a car couldn’t fly a plane.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>There were 122,000 airmen casualties total. [142]  It is quite reasonable to say that the wartime way of thinking—get the job done whatever the cost—served to obscure the very real dangerousness of flying (especially since they sent fliers out with as little as one hour of training in the aircraft they were flying). It is quite likely that this contributed to a false sense of what risks we would accept in the peacetime post-war world as compared with the benefits of flying.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The FAA and pilots associations make a big deal of flying safe, and thus paradoxically spend a lot of time talking about hazards and dangers and accidents, resulting in an anecdotal impression of a dangerous undertaking. The people who actually know would be my insurance company. The price for my all-hazards airplane insurance, covering everything from hitting a sparrow on approach to crashing into someone’s house, is less than $800 per year, in other words comparable to car or home insurance and considerably less than medical.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The leading cause of death among active pilots is ... motorcycle accidents.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>We are absolutely flat-out terrible at flying when we lose visual contact with the ground: you literally cannot tell which way is up. In fact it was solving the problem of control, attitude and steering, that was the Wright brothers’ seminal contribution to flying. They made bicycles, after all, and understood the importance of balance, and how it tied in with steering.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>If you tried to fly to lunch commercially, even if the actual flight itself were instantaneous, you would do nothing else that day.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />

    <p>the cost of the uranium going into power generation is trivial compared to the other costs. We could reduce even that by a factor of ten by going to a thorium fuel cycle, but one of the main reasons that there hasn’t been any major push to do that is that the uranium is already so cheap, on a per-kWh basis, that it’s not worth the bother.</p>

    <p>It’s not the absolute price of something that determines whether it makes sense to meter it, but the marginal price—what it costs you to generate one more kilowatt-hour, given that you’ve already built all the capital equipment and covered all the fixed overhead costs. It doesn’t mean it’s free, or even cheap—it just means you pay a flat fee, as you do for local phone service or basic cable.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The cost of actual electricity delivered to your home is due to the cost of the capital—the reactor and generating plant, but also the transmission lines, substations, power grid control centers, and so forth—and overhead, including maintenance and a truly staggering regulatory burden that multiplies the cost by an order of magnitude.</p>

    <p>nuclear fuels produce one to ten million times the energy per weight of chemical ones, and thus requires the extraction of a million times less raw material, and the production of a million times less ash, than fossil fuel for the same amount of energy. At the point where we were mining as much nuclear fuel as we are fossil fuel now, and thus spending as much for fuel as the current power industry, we would be generating a million times as much power.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>fuel costs are essentially trivial compared to fossil. The actual cost of power is all capital, actually even more so for nuclear than for so-called “sustainable” forms. A wind turbine uses up more lubricating oil than a nuclear plant uses uranium, per kilowatt-hour generated.</p>

    <p>Molten salt reactors using thorium and integral fast reactors using uranium-plutonium alloys could achieve a 99% fuel burn-up, improving both fuel efficiency and waste production by a couple of orders of magnitude over the 1960s designs we’re still using.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Nixon banished a reactor that was virtually meltdown-proof, left comparatively little long-lived waste, made it more difficult to fashion a bomb from the waste, ran at friendlier atmospheric pressure instead of the potentially explosive pressurized environments of conventional reactors, and ran at much higher temperatures, making it more cost-effective as an electricity generator.</p>

    <p>Thorium is often present in coal as a trace impurity. Typically, there is as much energy present in the thorium—which just goes out the smokestack—as we get from burning the coal.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>one of the main reasons thorium reactors weren’t developed in the Sixties. The U.S. government wanted a source of weaponizable uranium and plutonium. They went in with the mindset that we would control all the reactors and that the fuel cycle that gave us the bomb-grade stuff was a good idea. But that means that there has been a built-in block against making nuclear power generally available.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The other main reason was also military in origin—it was simply that pressurized water reactors had been designed and developed for the Navy, and it was easier to copy and scale up in a bureaucratic regime where not innovating is always easier than innovating.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>In the molten salt reactor, the design works the opposite way: cooling, enough to keep a plug of salt frozen, is powered by the reactor itself. If the reactor or generator fails, the plug melts, and the fuel flows into a sump where it’s too spread out to maintain a reaction.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The major problem with thorium as a nuclear fuel is, as mentioned, that uranium is too cheap already.</p>

Others begin to spend more resources and effort on finding new supplies or inventing substitutes. These are all exactly the things any sensible governor would do in the case of a shortage.

Modern rare-earth electric motors are in the same ballpark. But a Drexler electric motor, as mentioned in chapter 4, would produce about 3 billion horsepower per pound.</p>

    <p>There are something like 4 billion tons of uranium dissolved in the Earth’s oceans. That works out to be over 100 quadrillion watt-years of energy, enough to supply the current American 10 kW level of power to 10 billion people for 10,000 years.</p>

If we took out enough to lower the concentration, it would simply start leaching back out of the rocks to maintain the equilibrium.</p>

    <p>One of the major technological revolutions going on right now spells the nearing end of humanity’s first major world-changing technology: agriculture. Currently it looks like this: build a big warehouse-sized building. Inside, it looks something like a Walmart, but with the shelves going all the way up to the ceiling. Everything on each shelf is a growing lettuce, lit by special LEDs on the shelf above. The LEDs emit only the frequencies used by chlorophyll, so they are an apparently whimsical purple.</p>

    <p>Something like 80% of the land under cultivation in the US produces feed, mostly corn, soybeans, and hay. A much greater chunk of land goes to direct grazing. Right now all of that land serves primarily as a very inefficient solar collector, gathering the energy necessary to drive the rearrangement of atoms from CO2 back into hamburgers.</p>

    <p>For 60 years, General Atomic has been making and installing reactors for research that, unlike the big Navy-derived pressurized water reactors used for commercial power generation, are inherently safe—safe enough to be left in the hands of a drunken graduate student.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The TRIGA stands as a straightforward existence proof that safe reactors can be designed. How small could we make one? In a neutron-reflected, solution-based, moderated reaction, for example, the critical mass of plutonium-241 is 0.246 kg: just over half a pound, or 3/4 of a cubic inch. [246]  Cf-251, as noted above, if you have the nuclear technology to produce it, comes in at less than an ounce. Given how dense it is, that’s just one third of a teaspoon.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I’m doing nothing but back-of-the-envelope rumination here, but it does seem likely that with nanotech level engineering, the basic physics would allow for a reactor that would fit in a closet and produce on the order of a megawatt.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Nobody in their right mind would build a reactor like this for power production today (except on a space probe); it would be like buying a million-dollar computer in the 1960s just to play solitaire. But after 50 years of Moore’s Law, we do the equivalent all the time and think nothing of it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>With the physical productivity of a nanotech industrial base, what would be a ridiculously expensive way of powering a household, or a vehicle, could be perfectly reasonable given the other benefits: put your home anywhere, including a mountaintop in the Canadian Rockies, or on the south Pacific, or indeed surfing the jet stream at 50,000 feet. No power lines, no oil or coal deliveries, no emissions.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A home reactor providing an average 100 kW, about right for the Henry Adams curve in the Jetson era, would produce about an ounce of fission products per year. Most existing reactors running at that kind of power level don’t even bother to remove it from the fuel assemblies.</p>

    <p>In the Second Atomic Age, Litvenenko would have gotten a text from his left kidney telling him that it had collected 26.5 micrograms of Polonium-210, and what would he like to do with it?</p>

    <p>Full atomic control means that we do not have to thermalize chemical potential energy to use it. This in turn means that you don’t have to strain the bounds of material science to accomodate ultra-hot temperatures in your engine. It also means you get three or four times the usable energy from a given quantity of fuel, instead of sacrificing it on the altar of thermodynamics.</p>

    <p>you can suspend a live mouse in a 17-tesla magnetic field, as the field interacts with the diamagnetic properties of the water in the mouse’s cells. Similarly, you can attract liquid oxygen to a magnet because it is paramagnetic. You could in theory cause an increase in pressure in the air with a field in the hundreds of tesla range, although it would wreak havoc on pretty much anything else. In the meantime, of course, we can suspend trains with magnetic fields we can generate and control now, though their altitudes are measured in millimeters. We don’t know a way to levitate a car using magnetic forces at the altitudes of interest to us, but we certainly</p>

    <p>Should the cultural pendulum swing back, should we lose our idiotic fear of energy and regain the Henry Adams curve, or should there arise elsewhere a culture that has the same innovative spirit that we had just a century ago, huge technological advances could happen almost overnight as experimentation regains the lead, using all the “pent-up knowledge” of the past half-century as the overhang collapses, the dam breaks, and the technium surges into the forbidden valleys.</p>

    <p>As we slid from an optimistic world toward a pessimistic one, science fiction reflected the shift. From the technocratic utopia of Things to Come, to the future-as-now-but-improved background of Forbidden Planet, The Jetsons, and Star Trek, to the dystopias of modern SF in the vein of Terminator and Blade Runner, SF tracked our loss of faith in the future.</p>

    <p>Dystopia used to be a fiction of resistance; it’s become a fiction of submission, the fiction of an untrusting, lonely, and sullen twenty-first century, the fiction of fake news and infowars, the fiction of helplessness and hopelessness. It cannot imagine a better future, and it doesn’t ask anyone to bother to make one. It nurses grievances and indulges resentments; it doesn’t call for courage; it finds that cowardice suffices. Its only admonition is: Despair more.</p>
