    <p>We see the world, not as it is, but as we are—or, as we are conditioned to see it.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It was more than his pride could swallow to take the first step toward change.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>there are times to teach and times not to teach. When relationships are strained and the air charged with emotion, an attempt to teach is often perceived as a form of judgment and rejection. But to take the child alone, quietly, when the relationship is good and to discuss the teaching or the value seems to have much greater impact.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>The inside-out approach says that private victories precede public victories, that making and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others. It says it is futile to put personality ahead of character, to try to improve relationships with others before improving ourselves.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. ARISTOTLE</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>As you progress to deeper levels of understanding and implementation, you can go back time and again to the principles contained in each habit and work to expand your knowledge, skill, and desire.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor. HENRY DAVID THOREAU</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Reactive Language Proactive Language There’s nothing I can do. Let’s look at our alternatives. That’s just the way I am. I can choose a different approach. He makes me so mad. I control my own feelings. They won’t allow that. I can create an effective presentation. I have to do that. I will choose an appropriate response. I can’t. I choose. I must. I prefer. If only. I will.  </p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“My friend, love is a verb. Love—the feeling—is a fruit of love, the verb. So love her. Serve her. Sacrifice. Listen to her. Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her. Are you willing to do that?”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>words of both Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis, “Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Defend those who are absent. Be sincere yet decisive. Develop one new proficiency a year.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Do not fear mistakes—fear only the absence of creative, constructive, and corrective responses to those mistakes.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Listen twice as much as you speak.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>I will develop habits that free me from old labels and limits and expand my capabilities and</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Organize and execute around priorities.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It deals with things like building relationships, writing a personal mission statement, long-range planning, exercising, preventive maintenance, preparation—all those things we know we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing, because they aren’t urgent.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Most people say their main fault is a lack of discipline. On deeper thought, I believe that is not the case. The basic problem is that their priorities have not become deeply planted in their hearts and minds. They haven’t really internalized Habit 2.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>It’s almost impossible to say “no” to the popularity of Quadrant III or to the pleasure of escape to Quadrant IV if you don’t have a bigger “yes” burning inside.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>“My friend,” I said, “you can’t talk your way out of problems you behave yourself into.”</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>Real self-respect comes from dominion over self,</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>One of the most important ways to manifest integrity is to be loyal to those who are not present. In doing so, we build the trust of those who are present. When you defend those who are absent, you retain the trust of those present.</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>We have committed the Golden Rule to memory; let us now commit it to life.</p>
