    <p>right-parenthesis deficit disorder.

    <p>A few hours later I’m done setting up the proxy server. Most likely I am done because I have given up.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>A colleague says plaintively at some point, “I’d like to access JSTOR from home, but I don’t have the proxy server set up.” “Oh,” I exclaim jauntily, “I set mine up a couple of weeks ago. Works great.” “How did you ever find the time?” he asks admiringly. I don’t reply, but look smug.
</p>
    <hr class="chill" />
    <p>You have to get into the habit of forcing yourself to analyze, at the time you accept a task, the costs and benefits of doing a less-than-perfect job. You must ask yourself some questions: How useful would a perfect job be here? How much more useful would it be than a merely adequate job? Or even a half-assed job? And you’ve got to ask yourself: What is the probability that I will really do anything like a remotely perfect job on this?

    <p>Kaizen is a Japanese philosophy of continuous improvement through small, implement­able steps. If you say you are adopting the Kaizen Way, rather than simply that you are trying to procrastinate less, you will sound like you have adopted a martial arts regimen. That’s kind of cool.

    <p>You wouldn’t make these choices in the morning. But you can make these choices for yourself the night before.

    <p>Feeling good now comes at a cost. I won’t feel more like doing it tomorrow. Just get started.
