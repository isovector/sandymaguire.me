    My program in university was co-operative; after each school term
    I was expected to find and work a job for four months. Four months is just
    about as long as it takes most people to start feeling comfortable in a new
    codebase, and as a result, I needed to learn how to learn fast.
    </p>
    <p>
    It became clear to me that a great deal of human capital was being wasted
    simply trying to reverse-engineer these codebases.
    The industry prioritizes writing "readable" code, characterized by
    being verbose and "doing nothing clever". While each step along the way is
    indeed comprehensible, too often this desideratum manages to lose the original

    <i>intention</i> behind the code.

    </p>
    <p>
    Some friends and I decided to solve this. As our graduation capstone project,
    we built an analytics tool to determine
    <i>who knows what</i> in a codebase.
    By correlating commit information with between what code was physically
    on-screen, we found that we could outperform other contributors on both
    debugging and refactoring. Our results won us second-place in a project
    competition hosted by Yelp.

    </p>
    <p>
    At my last company our code was an impressively tangled, untestable ball of
    spaghetti. A stupid bug made it into production, and it cost us a few million
    dollars. I started looking for a preventative solution, and came across free
    monads.
    </p>
    <p>
    Free monads are a technique that allow for a separation of syntax from
    semantics. They allow you to quickly define a domain-specific language (DSL)
    appropriate for the problem at hand, and later provide interpretations for
    what that DSL means. These interpretations need not be unique, and can be
    composed at will. Different interpretations can provide dramatically different
    artifacts from the same code.
    </p>
    <p>
    Free monads, as they exist today, have a problem in the face of polymorphism.
    While nothing in principle prevents their DSLs from being polymorphic, the
    ergonomics around doing so are frustrating. Usages that are perfectly clear to
    humans are nevertheless ambiguous to the compiler. I want to develop a
    compiler plugin which is capable of resolving these ambiguities, by extending
    the unification algorithm to play nicely with polymorphic DSLs.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 2018, I realized I could take the approach of carefully evaluating only as
    much of a program as was necessary. In doing so, I could plumb through free
    monads, and perform static analysis on many things previously considered
    impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
    Historically, free monads have had problems with performance. Wu and
    Schrijvers have shown that efficient free monads are possible, though their
    technique requires a significant amount of boilerplate. I came up with a
    solution that could give free implementations of the boilerplate, at the
    expense of making the compiler's optimiser work harder. My work allows for
    free monads to be a true zero-cost abstraction, without the need for any
    tedious boilerplate.
    </p>
    <p>
    The zero-cost performance gains found here are impressive, though unreliable.
    The process requires the compiler to have total knowledge of the whole
    program, and requires hand-written annotations in order of having any chance
    of successfully optimizing the problem away. My results are a promising
    proof-of-concept; a robust solution will likely require finding an object-code
    format amenable to describing the DSLs as first-class concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
    Last year I wrote a book on type-level programming in Haskell. I wrote the
    copy in LaTeX, which came back to haunt me when I decided to publish an ebook
    alongside the print version.  While LaTeX provides an ergonomic writing
    environment, and makes it easy to spin up new abstractions, it doesn't give
    any tools to allow for different interpretations. For example, an ebook simply
    doesn't have the screen real-estate for a sidebar. This is an area in which
    I'd love to use free monads, but doing so will require better ergonomics for
    using them in non-programming domains.
    </p>
    <p>
    HTML is a successful document format, which makes the distinction between
    block and inline elements. Block elements may contain inline elements and
    other blocks, but inline ones may contain only other inline elements. Despite
    their advances over first-order effects, scoped effects are still not yet
    capable of modeling HTML elements. In my view, this restriction is rather
    embarrassing. It's caused by a lacking reification of the DSL capabilities

    <i>inside</i> a scoped effect. I don't think this is a fundamental limitation
    of the approach, merely one that could use some thinking.

    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, free monads strike me as having many desirable properties in
    knowledge work. The recent popularity of Jupyter notebooks suggests to me that
    not only do people want to give answers, but also show the means by which they
    were computed. But these are just two interpretations of the same thing! I
    dream of a day when all of our ad-hoc decision making is reified into data, to
    be reinterpreted at will. The implications for policy-making and transparent
    governance are especially staggering, and I'd like to do everything in my
    power to help make that future a reality.
