        <h2 id="looking-back">Looking Back</h2>
<p>With 2019 so recently behind us, it seems like as good a time as any to reminisce. This is actually my second attempt at doing a yearly write-up; as it happens, the year of our lord 2019 wasn’t a particularly good one for me, and as a result, my first write-up came off aggressively negative.</p>
<p>But negativity feels like a poor way to start the new year, and thus, I’ve decided to focus only on the best parts of the last one.</p>
<p>2019 started off with a great deal of promise. Ariel, one of my best friends, came to ring in the new year with me. We spent our time jamming on Grateful Dead covers, doing the monster mash, and listening to Suavemente… over and over and over again — much to the dismay of poor roommate James. For new years eve, we rigged up my old Arduino-controlled light vest, and headed down to karaoke night. Starting off with so much music inspired my only resolution for the year — to <a href="/blog/play-lots-of-music/">play more music</a>.</p>
<p>Too soon Ariel needed to head home, and I found myself deep in a new romantic relationship with my roommate. I knew it was a bad idea. She knew it was a bad idea. Literally everyone told me it was a bad idea. But we didn’t let that stop us. Instead we leaned into it. Maybe it was too much Elvis Crespo, or maybe it was too much lovey-dovey roommate stuff, but we accidentally pushed James out of the house. He left without so much as a word to me, while I was traveling in San Francisco. Apparently he responded less well to the Suavemente than I thought!</p>
<p>I was in SF for business. The AI-safety non-profit MIRI and I were courting one another, and after a successful first few interviews, they invited me down to meet in person. Since I had spent a few years there in the past, I decided to take the opportunity to spend a week in my old stomping grounds — meeting up with old friends and taking in the scene.</p>
<p>While it was excellent to see everyone, I noticed something scary. Every single one of my friends was aggressively depressed. They all seemed to simultaneously hate living in SF, and be completely oblivious to this fact. Their vibe reminded me of <em>my</em> depression when I lived in the Bay, and sufficiently spooked me away from attending the MIRI interview. I was afraid if I went I would be tempted to take the job, and subsequently need to return to the Bay.</p>
<p>My good friends Fintan and Vikrem also came to SF to see me. We spent the week getting into lots of trouble, including (but not limited to) being literally kicked in the ass by a hobo, and witnessing a back-alleyway blowjob.</p>
<p>Vikrem is a man who is notoriously anti-SF, and upon my return, he deluged me with SF-is-shitty memes. One of them was a video about some guy who lives in a shitty SF apartment without enough space, and so needs to rig up stupid engineering projects to cope. I felt inspired by the video, and decided to do some DIY to spruce up my own place in Ottawa.</p>
<p>The result was some lights beneath my bed that simulated the northern lights. They would imperceptibly change colors and patterns, but always be colorful and always fill me with joy. I also did some redecorating, and commissioned a painting from my friend Anika. It helped make Ottawa feel a little more like home.</p>
<p>But Ottawa never truly felt like home. I had moved there on a whim in September of 2018, mostly due to the convenience of it. I was moving back to Canada, but there was no obvious place to be — my family and friends had all performed their own diasporas, and there was no critical mass of people I knew anywhere. Other than SF, which was a) in the wrong country, and b) not a place I was going to move to.</p>
<p>The lesson I learned from living in Denver is that if a city doesn’t feel like home, it’s probably because you aren’t working hard enough to meet people. So I went out, in Ottawa. I joined a pub trivia group, a choir, a jam group, an engineering space, an improv troupe, the functional programming meetup, two climbing gyms, among other activities. Most of these were delightful amounts of fun, but I never really met anyone I really connected with.</p>
<p>Instead, I started diving into my work. A few weeks previous, I had come across an academic paper that promised to solve some theoretical problems I’d been wrestling with for two years. It caught my attention, and after internalizing the approach, I immersed myself. For eight to ten hours a day, for roughly four months, taking no time off, I worked and researched and created. It felt good. It was the only intellectual exercise I found myself getting in Ottawa. The result was my <a href="https://github.com/isovector/polysemy">polysemy</a> project.</p>
<p>Somehow, I became aware of the Montreal functional programming group, and was invited by the very excellent <a href="http://gelisam.blogspot.com/">gelisam</a> to come and give a talk. My presentation was on the research I’d been so deep into the last few months, and this was the first time I was widely showing it to the world. The response was stellar — not only the feedback from the talk, but also just all of the super-cool people I met.</p>
<p>At some point, I bought an <a href="https://onewheel.com/">electric, one-wheel skateboard</a>. Cruising through Ottawa late at night on that thing, grooving out to surf-rock was one of the closest things to ecstasy I’ve ever experienced. I rode it out through one too many thunderstorms, and waterlogged the electronics. In an amazing fit of engineering prowess, I later managed to fix all of the destroyed electronics. The joy of riding around on <em>previously broken,</em> electric, one-wheel skateboard <em>that you’ve fixed yourself</em> is even more incredible than the original experience.</p>
<p>My now-ex had decided she too was leaving Ottawa, but not for six weeks. It didn’t seem fair to kick her out and make her find such a short-term lease, so we continued living together. We decided to make the best of a bad situation, that we should unite against the manchildren in the basement, and not bring anyone home (our rooms shared a thin, thin wall.) Over the weeks, we tentatively became friends again, and it was nice. The city felt a little less empty.</p>
<p>I started thinking about leaving Ottawa. Living there had been a solid attempt, but was clearly a failed experiment. Unfortunately the situation hadn’t changed — there was <em>still</em> nowhere obvious to move to. I had an inkling of an idea, to emulate Paul Erdos and spend the rest of my life surfing on excellent engineers’ couches. I dreamed of moving from city to city, spreading my knowledge, connecting like-minded people, and building cool things. So I put out a call for interested parties, and my god did they come. Before I knew it, I had two years’ worth of couches to stay on. That cemented the idea, and I started planning to sell my things and learn how to live out of a suitcase.</p>
<p>As a test run, I reached out to two people in Toronto — my old friend <a href="https://github.com/davidrusu">David Rusu</a>, and my soon-to-be new one, <a href="https://github.com/JonathanLorimer">Jonathan Lorimer</a>. The experience was stellar. Both men were <em>hungry to create,</em> just like I was. In the course of a week, I think I did about 60 hours of dedicated engineering work. It was everything I had been dreaming about for a year. I returned to Ottawa, my heart heavy to be coming back, and knew it was time to pull the plug.</p>
<p>My other cousin Charlotte had recently moved to town, and we found ourselves reconnecting over a forgotten-decades-ago appreciation for Jeopardy. In a very fortuitous state of affairs, Jeopardy history was in the middle of being made, so we hunkered down at the beginning, and spent weeks powering our way through.</p>
<p>In my last weeks in Ottawa, an old friend and I went out to hip-hop trivia. We crushed it, placing first. WE ARE THE BIGGIE PROFESSORS — more like Notorious PhD, am I right???</p>
<p>I left my skateboard with John, the coolest person I’d met in Ottawa, though unfortunately I’d met him only a month before. In that time, we spent something like twenty hours discussing philosophy and life and all sorts of deep, interesting stuff. Leaving the skateboard and leaving John were the hardest parts of leaving Ottawa, so it seemed poetic to leave them together.</p>
<p>My last day in Ottawa rapidly approached, and I found myself on a bus to Toronto, to meet back up with Jonathan. He graciously invited me to give a talk at the Toronto functional programming meetup, and I accepted. There I had my first taste of fame, where after my talk, <em>everyone just hung around,</em> casually listening to me talk. There was a gaggle of like 20 fanboys, sitting around to hear me ramble on without a shred of eloquence about GADTs and type-level programming. I felt famous, like the next coming of Ed Kmett. Then we went to the bar and everyone forgot about me and the universe went back to normal.</p>
<p>Somehow I ended up in Vancouver, to stay with my excellent, ex-coworker, Travis, and an equally excellent old-friend, Andrew. Being back in Vancouver was delightful, especially my munchkining discussions with Andrew, weird mathematical discussions with Reed, and a wistful fourteen hour catching up with Erin — a personal favorite human of mine.</p>
<p>My location rapidly converged upon my parents’. I spent a nice week with them, involving swimming, learning to make Caesars, an excellent painting lesson from my aunt, and a fun night at the local observatory. My dad’s health isn’t particularly good, so I decided to be around for his upcoming operation a few weeks later.</p>
<p>In the meantime I went to visit the awe-inspiring <a href="https://chrispenner.ca/">Chris Penner</a>. We had a great week together, culminating in an epic piano jam sesh. It was the first test of my year’s new music skills, and I came out from it very impressed with my newfound abilities.</p>
<p>The plan was to head south into the States, and spend a few months rail-tramping my way across the continent. But my inclination to stay in North America was rapidly fading, so I took my friend up on her invitation to come to Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Amsterdam was much less fun than I was expecting. We spent most of our time in the library, but I did meet an old friend from back home who is now the Amsterdam cheese girl. So that’s cool I guess! Also I did a lot of bicycling, and came away convinced that bike-only cities are the future.</p>
<p>I went off to Munich. While waiting for the train (it had hit someone, and was thus DELAYED), I met a fun woman from Leipzig. She told me stories of being an au pair, and of her paired child who, in cold blood, threatened to set her on fire. We had a great chat, and she invited me to come visit.</p>
<p>In Munich I stayed with the excellent <a href="https://dev.to/jvanbruegge">Jan van Bruegge</a>. He met me at the train station at midnight, and despite having never met before, we quickly became close friends. That night, getting comfortable on his couch, I was struck by the most amazing feeling — that my life is so incredible, to have such fantastic people willing to host me on their couches. I’ve never experienced such true gratitude before.</p>
<p>Thank you, from the very bottom of my heart, to <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/erdos/">everyone who hosted me this year</a> — thanks David, Jonathan, Boris, James, Travis, Chris, Andrew, Gintare, Jan, Soares, Justin, Anna, Andy, Asad and Vincent.</p>
<p>My travels took me all over. I went to Leipzig to meet that woman from the train, and to play harmonica, and to do cool category theory stuff with Soares — who graciously invited me to the Haskell eXchange. I headed back to Munich to build watering systems and fight Scala’s variance mechanism with Justin. I had a romantic little week with Elli. I met up with Matiej, my close collaborator in Bratislava, and with an old flame in Vienna. She’s since gotten <em>fit</em> and took me to the gym during my visit, during which time I was completely emasculated by just how much stronger she was than I! Her roommate Andy and I had an excellent daylong conversation about computers, and I met the mysterious spy woman Moni, whom I was relatively certain wanted to kill me.</p>
<p>But she didn’t. And so I went to London.</p>
<p>London and I have been flirting with one another for years. I’d considered moving there in 2018 for a woman, in 2019 it invited me <a href="/blog/gatekept/">to do a PhD</a>. Then the Haskell eXchange rang, and I couldn’t resist its siren call. It was a grand time.</p>
<p>But a <em>weird</em> time. I met a lot of people whom I then considered to be personal heroes. It was a rather underwhelming — one was a total dick, and another seemed like he was intentionally not understanding what I was trying to say. But besides that, the conference was a blast. I met the eminent <a href="https://richarde.dev/">Richard Eisenberg</a>, who knocked me off my feet with his overwhelming intelligence, thoughtfulness and kindness. Another personal favorite person of mine, <a href="https://github.com/judah">Judah Jacobson</a>, was there, and reconnecting with him was particularly joyful.</p>
<p>HsX had too many excellent people to iterate them all, but one other person who stood above the crowd was <a href="https://github.com/masaeedu">Asad Saeeduddin</a>. I’d met Asad briefly in Toronto a few months earlier, where we’d had an amazing conversation and he’d taught me a whirlwind of cool new stuff. My intended roommate had come down with the plague, and so I found myself homeless. Asad kindly let me stay with him, and we had a few great nights sharing music and doing old-school bro-ing out.</p>
<p>Also, I found myself as a minor celebrity at HsX! Several people had read my book, and went out of their ways to say nice things about it. One guy interrupted my conversation with someone else in order to have his book signed. It was an incredible pleasure to feel just how much people liked this thing I’d created. And the conversation I was in wasn’t particularly good, so there was no love lost on that front.</p>
<p>During the tail-end of the conference, I got extremely sick. Like, “oh god, this is probably the night I die”-extremely sick. Thanks to Asad, I didn’t, but it was too close a call for comfort. Though I didn’t realize it at the time, this was a symptom of too much traveling, too much work, simply too much everything.</p>
<p>A few months earlier, I’d applied for a job at Imperial College, after not getting in with my PhD program. They called me in for an interview while I was in London, and apparently I aced it, because (SO MANY WEEKS LATER) they offered me the job. I spent a few days hanging around Imperial, working with my amazing, would-be colleagues, <a href="https://kcsongor.github.io/">Csongor Kiss</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.wu">Nick Wu</a>. I can’t say enough good things about these two. At the end of the day, I decided that my mental health wasn’t good enough to sign a year-and-a-half contract with Imperial, and so, with many regrets, I passed on the job. It was hard, but definitely the right thing to do.</p>
<p>A week later, back in Munich, I was still trying to sort out my life plans. I had several “maybe we could do this” options on the table, but nobody on the other side seemed very keen on giving me a definite yes or no. In a move of desperation, I booked a ticket for Bangkok two days ahead of time. I needed a reminder that this was my life, and that I was in control of it. And what a better way to remember than to drop everything and head to a different continent with no plans other than “diving might be nice” and “I need a place to write this book.”</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I’d decided to write a book, and was actively working on it.</p>
<p>During my last trip to Thailand, I’d met a man who continually told me of how great Koh Lanta was. Since I didn’t have any other ideas, I finally took him up on that. Over the next six weeks, Koh Lanta became the closest place to home I’ve had in several years.</p>
<p>Not much happens on Koh Lanta. It’s one big island with one big road going all the way along it. I spent my days swimming, reading, writing, playing guitar, doing karaoke, and socializing at the hostel.</p>
<p>Because Koh Lanta is nestled in the middle of several BIG PARTY PLACES, it filters those people out of the equation. As a result, those who come to Koh Lanta turn out to be stellar humans on average. Some particularly great people I met were Heleen, Lily, Pavel, Jake, Ciara and Toby. Ciara and I spent a week traveling together, and she helped me realize just how burned out by programming I really was.</p>
<p>I decided to <a href="/blog/burnout/">take a clean break</a> from programming and from writing the book I was working on. At time of writing, I now haven’t touched any software for a month — the first break of its kind in 16 years. It feels <em>so fucking good.</em></p>
<p>My Thai visa was expiring, so I took a trip down to the Krabi Immigration office in order to convince them to grant me another week in this magnificent country. While bopping around Krabi Town, I met Natalia — the most scintillating, inspiring and fun person I’ve had the good fortune to encounter in years. The last few weeks of 2019 were spent with her, painting and playing music and skinny dipping and drinking mocktails and engaging in lots and lots and lots of amazing conversations.</p>
<p>All in all, 2019 wasn’t stellar, but got markedly better since I made the decision to come to Thailand. I’m feeling mentally and physically healthier than I have in a long, long time. It’s a powerful way to start the new year, and I’m ready to make the most of 2020.</p>
<h2 id="work-and-misc-metrics">Work and Misc Metrics</h2>
<p>I (and a robot on my account that I’m unable/unwilling to separate) made 3,137 commits to software projects in 2019. Some of the most impressive things were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/merge_requests/668">GHC !668</a>: A patch to GHC that makes the simplifier work harder on higher-rank functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isovector/polysemy">polysemy</a>: My fast and easy effect system.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isovector/dynahaskell">dynahaskell</a>: A proof-of-concept editor for Haskell that writes most of your code for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isovector/suavemente">suavemente</a>: An applicative GUI that runs Haskell applications over websockets.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isovector/hs-vexflow">hs-vexflow</a>: A DSL for generating sheet music in Haskell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I spent 567h in 2019 <em>doing work</em> on miscellaneous projects, of which 156h were spent directly on programming and doing research for polysemy. Another 46h went towards writing <a href="https://www.patreon.com/designandinterpretation">Design and Interpretation of Haskell Programs</a>.</p>
<p>In total, I published 32 blog posts, totaling 46,000 words.</p>
<p>Additionally, I sold 847 copies of <a href="https://thinkingwithtypes.com">Thinking with Types</a> this year.</p>
<p>Scarily, I spent 258h on the functional programming slack — which probably greatly contributed to my eventual burnout. That is a <em>lot</em> of time to spend thinking about Haskell.</p>
<p>Some other miscellaneous things I spent time doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>215h on facebook messenger</li>
<li>65h on email</li>
<li>48h recording music and learning music theory</li>
<li>40h on the phone</li>
<li>24h reading papers</li>
<li>15h preparing talks</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent 3185 hours on the computer in 2019. Yikes.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/14778474">65 books</a> in 2019, which is a little better than my 56 in 2018, and much better than my 15 in 2017. Unfortunately, the books this year were lower quality on average, and finding five favorites was rather challenging. Regardless, here are my top books of 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530415.The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering">The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</a></em>: This is the most inspiring book I’ve read in a very long time. It’s Richard Hamming’s (of Hamming problems fame) self-proclaimed “manual of style.” TAoDSaE is a frank look at Hamming’s life, how he was successful, where he wasn’t, and commentary on how he should have done better. This is a refreshing style of autobiography, that’s chocked full of important advice on how to choose good problems, and how to have a meaningful career.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49634053-radical-markets">Radical Markets</a></em>: A book on interesting ways of applying more economic theory to everyday life. It makes strong arguments for better strategies of governance, taxation, and immigration that will plausibly lead to better allocation of global resources.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8205855-the-4-hour-workweek-expanded-and-updated">The 4 Hour Workweek</a></em>: Campy but good — a nice book on debugging your mind away from “I need to work a <em>job</em>” towards <em>I just need to make enough money.</em> Comes with lots of practical advice about how to actually go about doing this — though admittedly a lot of it is obsolete today in
<ol start="2020" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18930446-thinking-in-jazz">Thinking in Jazz</a></em>: My goal for 2019 was to get good at music, and so I picked up this hoping to get an idea of how people actually become jazz musicians. And amazingly, this book <em>delivered!</em> It’s a fascinating compilation of dozens of interviews with jazz musicians, coalescing the commonalities into “the way to think about jazz,” primarily using first-hand prose. I’d strongly recommend this book, even if you aren’t interested in learning to play jazz.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism">Digital Minimalism</a></em>: Cal Newport is back, making the claim that cellphones and social media are bad for us. He makes a good case. The reason I like this book is it confirms what I’ve been saying for years — being always connected <em>sucks.</em> Digital Minimalism offers a gentler path to kicking the habit than my recommendation of “throw your phone into the ocean. CMON! DO IT! STOP BEING AFRAID!” Somewhat amazingly, my approach has <em>never once</em> worked. Can you believe that?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I didn’t listen to a lot of music from 2019 <em>in</em> 2019, with the notable exception of <strong>Sandy’s Official Banger of the Year:</strong> <a href="https://everyoneisdirty.bandcamp.com/">Everyone is Dirty</a>’s <a href="https://everyoneisdirty.bandcamp.com/track/hit-girl">Hit-Girl</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite newly-found artists of 2019 were:</p>
<ul>
<li>GDP</li>
<li>Mac Miller</li>
<li>New Monsoon</li>
<li>Nik Baertsch</li>
<li>Rhymefest</li>
<li>Strangefolk</li>
<li>Tennyson</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d like to take a second to shout-out Rhymefest, who has my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMz6aRwpHVM">favorite rap line of all time</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re dangerous but I’m game for this and I don’t kiss ’cause that could get cankerous white girls complaining the sun is cancerous pull my dick out and I done caused the damn eclipse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess that’s as good of a place as any to leave this post. Thanks to everyone who helped make 2019 as excellent as it was, and here’s to an even better 2020. Much love.</p>

        <![CDATA[
        <p>Two days ago, I made some drastic measures — withdrawing from almost all facets of my online life. This has probably come as a surprise to many, and I feel like I owe some of you an explanation.</p>
<p>The short of it is that I’m tired out. Really fucking burned out. It’s sort of a weird thing to say, given that I’ve been retired for the last two years, but nevertheless, it’s true, somehow.</p>
<p>Since I first left Munich, I’ve had this unbearable weight on shoulders — exhaustion. I’d been couch surfing for three months, meeting up with nerds I’d met on the internet, and building cool things with them. I was <a href="https://isovector.github.io/erdos/">emulating my hero Paul Erdos</a>, who spent his life traveling and working with first-rate mathematicians. While a few of my hosts were excellent, first-rate engineers, most of them were not. What was once my joy, this Haskell stuff became blasee. I was hoping to rediscover my love of programming, but instead found myself arguing with people who just seemed unable to see the bigger picture, and teaching them everything I knew. Each and every one of them was a good person, but they simply weren’t the people I was looking for.</p>
<p>All of this culminated in London. The stress of nonstop traveling, combined with attempting to give an impromptu talk, at a conference where I was sure to meet an ex-girlfriend, that I still had feelings for, who clearly didn’t want to see me, was simply too much. I collapsed, and spent a night genuinely worried that I was on the absolute verge of death.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a great experience.</p>
<p>This last year has been a hard one. I found myself trapped in an emotionally draining relationship, and set my sights on doing work as a refuge. What began as <a href="https://github.com/polysemy-research/polysemy">a fun foray into some interesting questions</a> turned into a compulsion. I spent ten hours a day working on this research that not only did anyone understand, but also told me could never possibly work. I gave my heart and soul to a community that just didn’t seem to care.</p>
<p>Compassion and patience were my answer. To just keep reiterating my points, to always take the high road, to continue believing their attitudes stemmed from ignorance and not from malice. And it worked. Minds started changing, slowly but surely. I moved the discussion from “it’s impossible” to “ok, but how do I do this?” But every step was a fight, and soon all of the technical bits were finished. All that was left were the politics. My soul is truly that of an engineer, not a politician. It stopped being fun, and I felt like I was trying to help a group of people who truly were disinterested in my help. It left a sour taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>Then there was the <a href="/blog/gatekept/">Imperial fiasco</a>. For eight months they jerked me around, continually setting me up just to knock me down again. Eventually I did get my foot in the door, but by that point it was too late. I was no longer enthusiastic about the project, and I realized that my self-respect was more important to me than any pedigree they could lend to my name.</p>
<p>After all, turning down Imperial is almost as good as attending Imperial.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, I was also <a href="https://www.patreon.com/designandinterpretation">writing a book</a> on the same topics. It had been going slowly, mostly due to the burnout, but also due to the fact that I no longer have any skin in the game. I just don’t care if other people are writing good, maintainable software. <em>Who gives a shit?</em> But I promised myself that I’d work on it every day, and that I wouldn’t quit until it was published. And so I worked on it, true to my word, and hated every moment of it.</p>
<p>Software has stopped being fun for me. I’ve stopped learning, and instead have found myself in the role of an expert, which is nice, but the day-to-day feels too much like resting on my laurels, rent seeking, and answering the same questions day in and out. There’s not currently any joy in it.</p>
<p>Forcing myself to do more of it, out of some misplaced sense of identity, is clearly an aggressively unhealthy response to the situation. So, I just pulled out. I dropped my committee duties, rescinded my verbal agreement to a new job, gave up ownership of my programming project, announced that I’m no longer working on the book, and unsubscribed from every piece of programming media I could find. I need a clean break from it all, before I collapse again.</p>
<p>So instead, what? Honestly I’m not sure. But I’m hiding away in southeast Asia, learning new things and playing lots of music and doing lots of writing. And just generally doing stuff that feels good for the soul. I don’t know what healing is going to look like, or how long it’s going to take, but I’m not too worried. I’ll pull through; I always do. In the meantime, don’t expect much output on my end.</p>
<p>To everyone who has extended kind words, asking about me, thank you so much. I don’t have the energy to reply to you individually yet, but please know that I’ve read all of it, and appreciate each and every word. I love you all.</p>

      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
        <p>I read an excellent blog post yesterday: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/duv1x8/making_money_isnt_magic/">Making Money Isn’t Magic</a>. It’s a great look at strategies for generating cash. Several techniques that won’t get you rich quick, though they will clearly work given a year or two of preparation. And significantly less lead time if you come ready.</p>
<p>Anyway, this got me thinking about my approach to this money stuff — which is notably different than how most people seem to think about it. My family is aggressively the upper middle class. With the notable exception of a failed startup in the extended parts of the tree, every one of them works as a professional or at a not-for-profit. You name it, we got it. From engineering to law to medicine to police to university professor — my family has flourished by having a job and working for the man.</p>
<p>Tried and true, it’s a strategy that’s been working for us for generations — at least as far back in the lineage as I’m privy to.</p>
<p>With the exception of my uncle, there isn’t a shred of entrepreneurship anywhere in the blood. My family is particularly risk averse; not only in business, but also in temperament. The emphasis is and has always been on credentials and a good job with a good salary. Although no one would explicitly say it, I suspect they equate a hard day’s work with both financial success and with honesty. To make money without exchanging it for time at a linear rate is both unfathomable and immoral.</p>
<p>Me, I’m much more of a libertarian than my family is. Its the source of no end of (mostly) good-hearted ribbing at the Maguire-family dinner table. I believe that money is just and foremost a measure of value. We exchange money for things we care about more than money — otherwise tautologically we’d hold on to it.</p>
<p>If someone is willing to give you money, it means you are creating value for them one way or another. They must think it’s worthwhile. This was the first big hurdle in debugging my brain about money — and huge shoutout to <a href="https://joshkaufman.net/">Josh Kaufman</a> for spending an evening setting me straight. Where things go weirder is on the other side of that transaction. Just because someone is willing to pay me to do something doesn’t mean I must do it. Even if the money is really good.</p>
<p>Last week I stopped responding to a recruiter trying to place me at a job offering me half a million in salary. Tempting to be sure, but he got miffed when I asked to use Hangouts instead of doing a phone call. I don’t have a phone, you see. But instead of just saying yes, he got grumpy. I’m not sure if he’s lazy, inflexible, or incompetent, but either way, it reflects poorly on both him and the company. I don’t need the money, so why would I subject myself to that kind of an environment?</p>
<p>My rule of thumb is that the more a job pays, the more unpleasant it is. This is not a deep truth about the universe, but it seems to be a good heuristic nevertheless. If a job were good, they wouldn’t need to pay people so much to fill it.</p>
<p>Clearly this company thinks I’m worth the pay, but are <em>they</em> worth <em>my</em> time and attention?</p>
<p>The interesting thing about knowing how to make money is that it makes you care less about it. Once it stops being hard, you can just stay prepared and make some whenever you need it. I can’t generate $10k overnight, but certainly could in two weeks — probably in one if my life depended on it.</p>
<p>This is unfathomable to most people in most of the world. Nobody in Ottawa would give me an apartment because I didn’t have any “steady income.” They didn’t care that I could pay the entire lease upfront, nor that I <em>actually offered</em> it to them to get around the income “issue!”</p>
<p>There’s an excellent quote in the Elon Musk biography:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time Tesla interacted with Detroit it received a reminder of how the once-great city had been separated from its own can-do culture. Tesla tried to lease a small office in Detroit. The costs were incredibly low compared with space in Silicon Valley, but the city’s bureaucracy made getting just a basic office an ordeal. The building’s owner wanted to see seven years of audited financials from Tesla, which was still a private company. Then the building owner wanted about two years’ worth of advanced rent. Tesla had about $50 million in the bank and could have bought the building outright. “In Silicon Valley, you say you’re backed by a venture capitalist, and that’s the end of the negotiation,” Tarpenning said. “But everything was like that in Detroit.”</p>
<p>Ashlee Vance, Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Money really and truly is just a number in a computer somewhere — especially in the 21st century. So long as you have enough runway to last you until you’re prepared to make more, you’re fine. But this is where it breaks down for most people. Most people are under prepared and their spending is too damn high!</p>
<p>A few years before I retired (but after I had decided to,) I started judging amounts by how much of my retirement they would consume. After a few months of living well in Lithuania, I calculated that I could live on $25 a day, housing included. That meant every $25 I spent, I got one fewer day of <em>not working.</em> $25 doesn’t buy a hell of a lot; it doesn’t buy a thing! It’s meaningless psychologically, but my brain sure as heck understands the value of having a day off. And I’d gladly buy a <em>lot</em> of days off at $25 a piece!</p>
<p>I found myself doing the math before every transaction — and, almost always — realized it wasn’t a worthwhile trade. That’s a powerful technique they don’t teach you in school.</p>
<p>I’m not saying you too should measure your life in terms of $25-per-day retirement, but by god, measure it in terms of something meaningful to you! If you’re saving money, what are you saving it for? If you don’t set a concrete, specific goal, you’ll never get there — forever making money you don’t need to spend on things you don’t really want.</p>
<p>Is “owning” a mortgaged house really worth the down payment and mandated years of slavery to pay off the rest of it? I’m not so sure, but I do know how much life you can buy for that same down payment. And I guarantee you that the grind to make the mortgage payment gets in the way of a lot of preparation to make money.</p>
<p>Out of all my professional engineering friends, I’m probably the poorest of all of them, likely by a factor of 5x or more. But I haven’t worked a job in two years. I travel all around the world on a whim, and spend month at a time living on tropical islands and doing scuba everyday. Amazingly, despite this, my bank account has the same number it showed the day I quit working.</p>
<p>I don’t live off the interest or any “safe” strategy like that — I just have lots of time and energy to create. And that’s the kind of stuff that people find valuable and are willing to pay me for. Is it a lot of money? No, it works out to about minimum wage, but that pays for rent, food, travel, and diving vacations. Crucially, it’s not a minimum wage that I need to spend 40 hours a week earning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, every time I go to visit my professional friends, I’m struck by <em>just how miserable</em> they are. And what’s worse is they don’t even notice it — not even after breaking into tears at the mall food court. But this is a choice that they are making, every day. It’s the safe path that I inherited from my upper-middle class upbringing, and likely they from theirs. But all you need to do is pay rent and food. Literally all the rest is non-essential bonus stuff.</p>
<p>Find a way to take care of that part, and then spend a lot of time thinking about what you want your life to look like. How much money do you need to make that happen?</p>
<p>One common objection I hear to this is “but I don’t know, so I will keep making money until I figure it out.” This would indeed be a good strategy if it weren’t based on a fundamental misunderstanding. Deciding what you want your life to look like is scary as hell (“what if I get it wrong?”) and so defaulting to the status quo is a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Instead, we must ask ourselves whether we want the rest of your life to look like it does now. We must come to grips with the fact that this is all it’s ever going to be, unless we change it. This is all we get. Lets try our best not to squander it.</p>

      <title>The Mechanics of Writing a Book</title>

      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
        <p>One of my core tenets is that processes are much more important than results. A well-executed result is good for me, but a good, reified process is good for the world. Far too much human ingenuity is spent figuring out how someone else made something cool, and we’d all be better off if we could just communicate those things openly.</p>
<p>If you haven’t heard the good word, I’m actively writing a book called <a href="https://www.patreon.com/designandinterpretation">Design and Interpretation of Haskell Programs</a>. It’s about writing good and robust software in Haskell, something that is regrettably not yet very well known. But don’t worry, I’m not going to talk about Haskell today. I want to talk about how I go about writing a book.</p>
<h2 id="where-does-a-book-come-from">Where Does a Book Come From?</h2>
<p>I write practical nonfiction. My impetus to write nonfiction comes from spending a lot of time thinking about just how frustrating life today is, and how it doesn’t need to be that way. Paul Graham has a quote on this that I really like and identify with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Live in the future, then build what’s missing.</p>
<p>-Paul Graham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For me, writing books isn’t about <em>building,</em> but about <em>bridging.</em> In technology, most of our problems were solved 30 years ago, but nobody knows about it because minds are slow to change and academics are particularly bad at communicating. As such, my work doesn’t contribute anything new, it just synthesizes other people’s work into one place.</p>
<p>This is great news, because it means that I can just spend lots of time reading weird, obscure things, and keep track of which ones feel like they’re onto something. I’m very familiar with the day-to-day workings of my field, and by paying attention to research that tackles the everyday problems, that’s most of the work right there.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, a book comes from wanting the world to be different, and, in particular, knowing in what way you’d like it to be different. If your personality is like mine, this is sufficient motivation. Knowing the right answer and feeling like society is to sluggish to get there on its own makes it feel like writing this book is a <em>responsibility</em> that you have to the world.</p>
<p>If you are going into this project to get rich, <em>stop right now.</em> It’s a) the wrong motivation, because you probably won’t, and b) going to be very obvious to all of your readers. Audiences can smell a cash grab a mile away, and aren’t likely to reward you with their hard-earned cash.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>I begin by identifying a theme for the book. Roughly, what is it going to be about? This thing should be the length of a subtitle, for example “type level programming in Haskell” or “a guide to building robust software.” Having a theme helps identify who would be interested in such a thing, and roughly what sorts of things you should be writing about (which is less obvious that it sounds!)</p>
<p>This gets me thinking about the people that I know personally. Are any of them the target audience? I’ll make a list of people I know who might be interested, and then roughly estimate how much they know about the topic at hand. I am always looking for someone I know personally who is a) smart, b) interested, and c) average in their knowledge on the subject.</p>
<p>After identifying one to three of these people, I’ll go and explicitly say to them “hey, I’m thinking about writing a book on topic X — how likely would you be to buy such a book?” I will iterate on the theme, and the people until I find a combination that evokes enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm is the key. I am looking for sentiments along the lines of “thank god, I’ve been waiting for someone to write that,” or “I didn’t know I wanted that, but now I can’t wait,” or, “shut up and take my money!” If you can evoke that sort of response, and have no reason to believe that your friend is alone in that opinion, then congratulations. You’ve found a market for your book.</p>
<p>It’s important to target a friend who is in the average understanding. If you find someone who is far below average, your book is going to need to spend a lot of time covering first principles. If they’re far above average, the pool of people who will buy your book is going to be unreasonably small.</p>
<h2 id="the-target-audience">The Target Audience</h2>
<p>This enthusiastic friend of yours is your greatest asset in writing a book. You are writing this book <em>for them,</em> and for no one else. The goal is to take your friend, at their current level of understanding, and gently lead them to your point of view. Doing so requires a deep understanding of what you want to teach, but it requires a <em>deeper</em> understanding of the way that they see the world. It’s okay — and natural — to be a little fuzzy on what you’re going to write about. That part gets solved by actually writing it. But you need to understand your friend well enough that you can frame the problem and motivate the solution in language that they can understand.</p>
<h2 id="promise-yourself-to-get-it-done">Promise Yourself to Get It Done</h2>
<p>I always make a promise to myself that if I’m going to do this work, I’m not going to waste my time by <em>not finishing it.</em> That’s not to say I should sink my costs if the book truly isn’t very good, but it’s a good defense against akrasia.</p>
<p>This comes in two flavors. The first is that while I’m committed to finishing the project, I need to work on it <em>every single day.</em> “Working” here is intentionally defined very loosely. Fixing a typo counts as doing work. Writing a single sentence, or editing a paragraph for flow counts as doing work. Obviously, writing significant amounts of prose also counts as doing work. So long as my document isn’t in exactly the same state as it was 24 hours ago, it counts.</p>
<p>The psychology here is that projects that are always being worked on are eventually finished. But, it’s an acknowledgment that life can often get in the way of the best laid plans. And so, we define progress by input, not by output. So long as you do <em>something, anything,</em> you haven’t broken the streak.</p>
<p>Having a low barrier on this front is amazingly powerful. Often I’ll find myself in bed getting ready to sleep, and realize “oh shit, I didn’t work on the book yet today!” My initial reaction will be “eh… fuck it.” But having such a low barrier to progress means I’ll feel like a piece of shit if I’m <em>so lazy</em> that I can’t manage to pull open my laptop, write a single sentence, and then put it away again. It’s the inertia the counts, not the speed.</p>
<p>Working on it every day is a good way to prevent the accidental death of your project. But it’s not a good strategy if this thing you’re creating <em>truly isn’t worth finishing.</em> For that, I also write a quick document describing under which circumstances I’m allowed to quit, and when. For example, on my last book, I wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When To Quit</p>
<p>There will be no quitting, unless another book comes out before this, also targeted explicitly at type-level programming in Haskell, which is judged by me to be superior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how clear that is. It gives an explicit stop condition — someone writing a better book, <em>as judged by me.</em> In fact, while writing my book, someone else did publish first, but after skimming a few chapters, it was clearly an inferior product. Rather than let it get me down, I realized that neither my mission nor the world had changed in light of this other book, and so I should keep my head down.</p>
<p>And the market agreed with me. To date I’ve sold at least 20x more copies! The power of strategic perseverance is a powerful one,</p>
<h2 id="work-on-philosophy-first">Work on Philosophy First</h2>
<p>Spend a lot of time writing the philosophy of the way you see the world. Describe the problems you see with great anguish. Really sell just how painful this experience is, and try to motivate a world in which we haven’t already internalized this pain. How if your solution were already the status quo, we’d never think about trying the things we’re doing now. Rhetoric is a powerful tool here.</p>
<p>Your argument doesn’t need to be technical. Not yet. All it needs to do is be strongly motivating. You need to convince your reader that this problem is worth solving, and, by extension, that your book is worth reading.</p>
<p>Throughout the writing process, I will often finish five or six chapters along these lines. Few if any of them end up in the final print. But the exercise is not for naught; by expounding on these issues you will clarify exactly what problems you see, you will discover a natural structure for the book, and you will come up with good material for copy.</p>
<p>The philosophy is much easier for people to understand than the technical solutions. The latter require significantly more attention, and so by making the philosophy as persuasive as possible, you are readying your reader for the difficult tasks ahead. In my experience, very few nonfiction books take the motivation aspect seriously enough. With so many excellent books out there, it takes quite a lot to convince me that <em>this one in particular</em> is worth reading.</p>
<p>Nailing the motivation is by far the hardest part of the process. So spend lots of time waxing poetically on the way the world should look. Tackle it from as many different angles as possible. If possible, show that several real problems all share the same structure, and thus that your one solution would solve all of them simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="test-your-assumptions">Test Your Assumptions</h2>
<p>Take two of your best motivating pieces, and start rolling with them. Find a relatable example, show how it’s a problem with traditional methods, and do a case study of applying your technique to it. You don’t need to spend a lot of time on this, just enough to convince yourself — and an audience — that everything works as you say it does.</p>
<p>Write prose around the example, explaining every piece in great detail. Assume the reader knows exactly what your target audience friend does, and explain the bits that you would explain to your friend. Walk them through your thought process, about when this technique can be expected to work, and good heuristics for how to use it.</p>
<p>Tackle two of these case studies, ideally two that are in very different domains, which can showcase different aspects of the solution.</p>
<p>Compile the two case studies and two best pieces of philosophy into a single document, and spend an hour or two polishing it. When you’re done, here comes the scary part: sharing it. You need to distribute this document of yours widely. Make it freely available in the circles that your ideal readership hangs out in. See how people respond to it. Make the necessary changes in order to convince them that your nascent book is worthwhile.</p>
<p>If you’ve done your homework and made a compelling case, I suspect the audience will be supportive. But there’s always the chance they aren’t, and this too is valuable. Honestly consider their concerns. If you can’t convince your core audience to get excited about this thing, you’re probably not going to convince a wider audience either. If it seems like the problems are solvable, go back to the drawing board and try again. Otherwise, now might be a good time to cut your losses.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is about as far as I’ve gotten in my new book, so it’s as much as I’ve been reminded about. More to come as I get further in.</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>It is important in life not to be strong, but to feel strong.</p>
<p>-Christopher McCandless</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m writing this in the park, sitting in the first sun that Munich has seen in a week. This wasn’t my plan for today, which was to stay inside in a Haribo induced stupor, watching Starcraft. You see, I’ve been traveling now for three months, sleeping on strangers couches and doing nonstop programming. I’m absolutely exhausted, and so my mini stay-cation in Munich has been less productive than I’d like.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about today are moments of strength — those rare times when you’re feeling slightly more powerful than usual. These are exceedingly valuable events and should be sought out and capitalized on whenever they occur. Using your moments of strength wisely in your most powerful tools for improving your life.</p>
<p>The other day, in a moment of strength, I realized I was wasting too much of my attention on watching useless YouTube videos And so, while I had the clarity and ability to do so, <a href="/blog/reclaim-your-attention/">I blocked the entire website</a>. Now in my moments of weakness, I can’t renege on this, and am forced to find more productive ways of spending my time. I took advantage of my moment of strength, and fixed a glaring problem in my life.</p>
<p>The idea is that most of the time, we are not very strong, and so we should take these rare opportunities to change our lives so we don’t <em>require</em> strength. And the easiest time to do this is when you are feeling strong.</p>
<p>I have a friend who says she feels trapped in her life. We have spent a lot of time together over the last few weeks, and while she certainly has real problems, they don’t seem nearly as insurmountable to me as to her. Over this time, I’ve seen quite a few moments of strength in my friend, though unfortunately I’ve seen most of them go squandered. Rather than taking the opportunity to solve a problem, she will often bask in the feeling of strength. This is not <em>bad</em> per se, but it is strategically shortsighted.</p>
<p>Moments of strength are great opportunities for bootstrapping oneself. The next time you feel more capable than usual, even if only by a little, look at it as a rare chance to fix a problem. And act immediately on it-it might not stick around for long. That habit is what compelled me to grab my notebook, walk to the park, and write this essay that I’ve been meaning to get to for months.</p>
<p>Capitalizing on moments of strength is a habit you build over time. The next time you have one, use it to catalog the big problems in your life — the things getting in the of the life you want to live. Make an actual list, and make sure it’s easily accessible for the next time you have a moment of strength.</p>
<p>Circle any problems that are easy to tackle-things like making a phone call or could otherwise be solved in an hour. Put a star next to the most important item on your list. If, after making the list, you’re still feeling motivated, pick one and go solve it <em>right that second.</em> Don’t think about it, don’t give yourself a chance to lose momentum. Just start moving. That second. Don’t have a shower first. Put on your coat and start moving out the door, or start dialing the member, or whatever it is you need to actually do.</p>
<p>If you are tempted to get distracted, make a mental note to remove that sort of distraction during your next moment of strength, and then, crucially, don’t get distracted. Don’t let yourself stop until you’ve made real progress towards your goal.</p>
<p>I actually just left the park, as it was getting cold and the mosquitoes were coming out in full force. As I got home, I noticed I was hungry, and that I had quite a few interesting emails that could use some of my attention. But I know from lots of past experience that if a blog post doesn’t get finished in one sitting, it never will be. And so here I am, ignoring my inbox and trying not to think about how hungry I am, because I am temporarily feeling strong and that’s much more important.</p>
<p>Moments of strength beget other moments of strength in two ways. The first is that, as you start solving problems in your life, they’re no longer there to get in the way of solving more problems. The second is that <em>you are actually getting stronger,</em> which itself leads to having more moments of strength. After you accomplish something you’ve been putting off, take a few minutes to sit and appreciate the glorious feeling that comes with it. This is the greatest feeling in all of life, better than any orgasm, meal or drug.</p>
<p>This feeling alone is enough to make life worth living. If you’re not very well acquainted with it, you are in for one hell of a ride. Treasure your moments of strength, and they will reward you in turn.</p>

      <title>Generalized One-Night Stands</title>
      <id>blog/one-night-stands/index.html</id>
      <link href='blog/one-night-stands/index.html'/>
      <published>2019-10-07T19:54:00Z</published>

      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
        <p>We’re all familiar with the idea of the one-night stand. You’ve been feeling frisky with some <em>pent-up sexual desire</em>, and hook up with someone who is in a similar situation. Although you usually don’t explicitly call it out, the understanding is that you’re just two humans who want to rub their genitals together, without any implications that you’ll be doing <em>anything other than that.</em> No follow up, no staying in touch. Just some raw, unadulterated adult fun.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, I’m not here to talk about my one-night stands. I’m actually pretty shit at them; I catch the feelings too easily. But my god are there a lot of terrible stories on that front that maybe I’ll get around to writing about one day. But anyway.</p>
<p>Last week I had a nice few days of a faux-relationship. It was clear nothing could or would happen between us long-term, but that didn’t mean we couldn’t pretend in the meantime. We got to spend some time cuddling, sharing our interests with one another, and just generally feeling like someone else out there cares. Just two lonely souls meeting serendipitously, and being brave enough to give it a shot.</p>
<p>It’s sort of dumb in retrospect, but until this, I’d never really considered the idea that I have needs that can only be satisfied by <em>other human beings.</em> It’s a vulnerable feeling, especially due to how independent I view myself.</p>
<p>But this reminded me of a conversation I had a few years back with my friend Daniel McCracken. He mentioned the idea of an <em>emotional one-night stand</em> — one in which you find some company for the night, but unlike in a traditional one-night stand, all you’re looking for <em>is the feelings.</em> This strongly resonated with me, probably because some of the most influential experiences in my life have come from <a href="/blog/showing-me-the-way/">such encounters.</a></p>
<p>But why do we need to limit ourselves to just sexual and emotional one-night stands? In true math-nerd fashion, why not <em>generalized one-night stands?</em> The coming together of two souls who are looking for something very specific from one another — regardless of whether they can articulate <em>what,</em> exactly. What’s stopping us from having intellectual one-night stands, or from talking-about-how-hard-it-is-that-our-parents-are-getting-older one-night stands?</p>
<p>I’ve now been traveling as part of my <a href="https://isovector.github.io/erdos/">Erdos project</a> for 10 weeks. The idea is to run around the world, sleeping on peoples couches, and doing non-stop programming in the meantime. It’s a way to meet My People, and collaborate with them to help make the world a better place.</p>
<p>So far it’s been a great experience and all, but programmers are not well-known for their apt social-skills. And now that I’ve been thinking about generalized one-night stands, I’ve come to the conclusion that not all of my social needs have been being met by the people with whom I’ve chosen to spend the immediate next part of my life.</p>
<p>When you’re looking for a casual encounter, there are some obvious choices about where to go. The night club toilet, for example, is usually a pretty solid bet. But when you are looking for an emotional one-night stand, well, that’s a trickier thing to sort out.</p>
<p>When I put up the call for couches to stay on, I was amazed at how positive the response was. Within a few hours, I already had two years’ worth of places to stay. It was overwhelming. And I think the reason for that was that these people were looking to me to help with some of their generalized one-night stands. These people are looking for companionship in an extremely narrow niche. You don’t learn Haskell by giving up easily on difficult problems, but it does aggressively filter out the people you can share your passions with.</p>
<p>Very few people can talk at length about functors, after all.</p>
<p>But the more people I meet on my trip, the deeper my understanding of this goes. It’s clear that everyone I’ve met so far is aching for some niche intellectual discussion. But when you start looking for what else people are longing for, you start seeing it. Camaraderie. Affection. Loyalty. A role model. Confidence. Understanding. Inspiration. Sympathy, or at least someone to complain to. Respect. A feeling of worthiness. Exaltation.</p>
<p>The things that people long after are not often the things they mention. But they’ll tell you in other, subtler ways.</p>
<p>As an aggressive icebreaker, I like to ask people “who are you, as a <em>person?</em>” Partially because I think it’s funny when people are temporarily existentially uncomfortable, but also because I learn a lot about them from how they respond. The way they describe themselves are the things they outwardly care about, and are often more of a statement about who they’re trying to be, rather than who they necessarily <em>are.</em></p>
<p>For the last few years, my unofficial philosophy has been to always behave in such a way that people considered themselves better off for having met me. Modest it is not, but at least it comes from a good place. Cementing the concept of generalized one-night stands has helped me live up to this ideal. Make it a priority to find what people are seeking, and then help them with it if you can. At the very least, it’s a pretty reliable means of getting an invitation to come back and stay on their couch again.</p>
<p>The shift in perception that comes from seeing myself as a creature with social needs has been earth shattering, and the realization that <em>other people</em> have these needs too, even more so. Maybe this is why I struggled so much to connect with people in Ottawa. Maybe I didn’t know how to fulfill these needs, in either myself or in others.</p>
<p>Maybe, despite the name, this is the stuff of which long-term human relationships are made.</p>

      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
        <p>A few days ago I got rejected from a PhD program at Imperial College London — a program I was <em>invited to apply for by a member of their faculty who wanted to supervise me.</em> The experience left a sour taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>The official reason for the rejection is that my undergraduate GPA is too low. 0.86% too low, in fact. Missed it by a hair!</p>
<p>In my eyes, I’m a pretty outstanding candidate. In the last two years I’ve solved two <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/prospecting-free-monads/">major</a> <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/polysemy/">problems</a> in my field — both of which people frequently said I should stop wasting time on, because they fundamentally couldn’t be solved. I didn’t work on the problems to publish them or for the fame or anything; I was just annoyed that I couldn’t do something that seemed so obviously <em>possible.</em></p>
<p>My <a href="https://sandymaguire.me/resume.html">professional experience</a> is characterized by doing extracurricular tasks to solve technical debt that nobody else wanted to touch, and by <em>knocking assigned tasks out of the park:</em> I single-handedly made Facebook $60M in four months while I was an intern, and I successfully tackled design work at Google that people said I needed five years more experience in order to have any chance at.</p>
<p>The point is not to toot my own horn here, but merely to point out that I have a proven track record of self-directed study, of hard work, of executing on what I say I’m going to do, and of excelling at it.</p>
<p>But no. My average grade is 0.86% too low to qualify. Looking at <em>average</em> grades strikes me as a particularly stupid strategy for assessing PhD work. PhDs aren’t supposed to be well-rounded; they’re <em>experts in narrow fields.</em> Looking at average grades equally weighs my 68% in a mandated, irrelevant-to-my-degree, automatically-get-15%-for-putting-your-name-on-the-final class on “The Role of Technology In Society” against my 92% in a voluntarily taken, relevant-to-my-degree (and PhD topic) class on compilers — widely regarded as one of the hardest three classes in the most challenging technical university in the country.</p>
<p>“The Role of Technology in Society” was clearly a waste of my time, so I did only as much as I needed to in order to pass, and no more (I was actually aiming for 51%, but that blasted extra 15% blindsided me). Compilers, on the other hand, are a subject very close to my heart, and are something I’d like to dedicate my life to thinking more about.</p>
<p>If your goal really is, as Imperial College London <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/strategy/developing-this-strategy/strategy2014/mission/">claims</a>, “to deliver world class research in engineering” — then weighing “The Role of Technology in Society” equally against actual technical topics is <em>profoundly stupid.</em> If we take them at their word that my low marks are the problem<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> then this decision is <em>elitist gate-keeping</em> at its worst, rather than any honest attempt at producing good research. It’s a reactionary strategy to willingly accept false-negatives in order to maintain its prestigious name, rather than willingly accept false-positives and actually try to do more of what built its name in the first place.</p>
<p>I sound saltier than I actually am. Seven days ago I’d never even considered applying to Imperial College London; so not being there in September is exactly the same state of affairs that my life was already in. Their decision hasn’t dashed my plans or anything. Despite the fact that I’m apparently <em>not worthy</em> of attending ICL, I’m pretty sure this is a bigger problem for them than me.</p>
<p>For my part, I’m just going to keep doing my own research. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f61KMw5zVhg">To quote Feynman</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m appreciative for the work that I did, and for the people who appreciate it. And I notice that other physicists use my work. I don’t need anything else. I don’t see that it makes any point that somebody … decides that this work is noble enough to receive a prize. I’ve already got the prize! The prize is the pleasure of finding the thing out. The kick is the discovery, the observation that other people use it. Those are the real things. The honors are unreal to me.</p>
<p> When I became a member of the National Academy of Science I had ultimately to resign. Because there was another organization, most of whose time was spent in choosing who was “illustrious” to be allowed to join us in our organization… the whole thing was rotten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that sums up my feelings pretty well. Maybe it’s sour grapes, but if Imperial College London really and truly believes I’m not good enough for them, well, good riddance! It’s their loss, really!</p>
<p>In conclusion, I’d like to extend an open invitation. If you, like me, believe that effect systems and free monads are what programming is going to look like in 30 years, please get in touch. I’d love to talk with you. Regardless of your academic or industrial affiliation, regardless of your skill level, and <em>especially</em> regardless of your GPA. Get in touch.</p>
<p>Ideas like these are the ones that change the world, and I’m willing to dedicate my life to it. If you are too, then why the hell aren’t we already collaborating?</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>Greatness is something you do, not something you are.</p>
<p>-Sebastian Marshall</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="i">I</h1>
<p>My friend Csongor <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/03/ho-haskell.pdf">recently published a computer science paper</a> that’s super interesting if you’re as big a nerd as I am. The details are too much to go into here, but suffice to say, it lets us do a lot of things I’d always been told were impossible.</p>
<p>Being told you’re now allowed to do the impossible is a staggering experience.</p>
<p>What’s more staggering is knowing the guy responsible for letting you do it.</p>
<p>I was curious about how he’d gone about solving this problem. Part of it was a question of ego — I’d run into this problem around the same time Csongor had. But where he’d stuck with it and eventually broken through, I’d bounced off it assuming there was a <em>reason</em> for the limitation.</p>
<p>Csongor is obviously brilliant, <a href="/blog/no-miracle-people/">but I don’t think his brain works <em>significantly better</em> than mine</a>. Rather than assuming he’d solved the problem because he was smart and I wasn’t, I took the position that he had some <em>skill</em> that I was missing. Skills, after all, can be learned.</p>
<p>And so I asked him. How did he start working on it? What was the process like? How long did it take? His answer to the first question<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to understand why this limitation was there. Then learning the answer revealed that it’s actually something that can be fixed — as is always the case with these things if you think about them enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He made sure to reiterate the point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though I must say that the solution is really quite obvious once you know the underlying reasons, so there was not much brilliance involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="ii">II</h1>
<p>Sometime recently, without realizing it, I’ve become a big wig in my nerdy programming circle. All of a sudden people were throwing my name around in the company of the people I looked up to, whose work I’d always felt was far beyond my grasp.</p>
<p>This was puzzling to me for an embarrassingly long time. What had changed? I was still the same guy as always, doing lots of experiments and having 95% of them fail on me. I was still as outspoken as ever.</p>
<p>What changed? I think it’s that I wrote a <a href="https://thinkingwithtypes.com/">book</a>.</p>
<p>All of a sudden my status jumped up a few rungs because my ideas were worthy of <em>a book.</em> I mean, it’s a great book and <a href="https://thinkingwithtypes.com/">you should go buy a copy</a>, but it’s nothing novel. It’s just a consolidation of lots of existing techniques, that I painstakingly put in the time and sweat to understand for myself.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, people had a good educational resource, and it had my name attached to it. The book doesn’t pull any punches — it really and truly is a book of difficult things — but it tries to introduce the ideas as gently and usefully as possible.</p>
<p>I think what happened is that people started thinking “man, this book is full of really hard concepts. The guy who wrote it must be really smart.” And they’re not <em>wrong</em>, but that’s not the point. Really, most of it I learned from long conversations with exceptionally kind and patient people like <a href="https://ren.zone/">Renzo Carbonara</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/shajra?lang=en">Sukant Hajra</a>.</p>
<p>The point is that all people see are my successes. They see this book in its finished form, but are shielded away from the tortuous months I spent writing it. They aren’t aware of just how many hours I spent fighting with LaTeX. Or of cajoling my designer-then-girlfriend to help me pick fonts. Or from the countless sleepless nights I spent spinning the ideas around in my head, trying as best I could to find something, <em>anything,</em> to grab on to.</p>
<p>None of it was exceptionally difficult. Mostly it was just tedious.</p>
<p>The book itself took four months to write, but the material took five years to <em>learn</em>. And that seemed like a waste of time if I wasn’t able to amortize by that helping other people learn the same things.</p>
<p>Any idiot could have done what I did — read blog posts, think hard about them, write some code that used the idea, and then write one chapter at a time. That’s it. There was no magic.</p>
<h2 id="iii">III</h2>
<p>The point I’m trying to make here is that, on the inside, it doesn’t feel remarkable to do “great” work. Csongor says “there was not much brilliance involved” in his work. I’m convinced that any idiot could have put together the same book that I did.</p>
<p>The hardest part is putting in the time, and even that’s not very hard if you find the process enjoyable and meaningful.</p>
<p>To quote <a href="https://www.gwern.net/index">Gwern</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>None of these seems special to me. Anyone could’ve compiled the DNB FAQ; anyone could’ve kept a list of online pharmacies where one could buy modafinil; someone tried something similar to my Google shutdown analysis before me (and the fancier statistics were all standard tools). If I have done anything meritorious with them, it was perhaps simply putting more work into them than someone else would have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or as <a href="https://twitter.com/jkachmar">Joe Kachmar</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s really nice to realize that most/all of the work on these big projects is just folks who have relentlessly kept tugging on some thread until it unravels neatly for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There likely are problems out there that are <em>brilliance-constrained,</em> but I’d argue that there 100x more problems which are merely <em>effort-constrained.</em> This is good news, because while it’s not clear how to become smarter, it’s very doable to just throw more energy at something.</p>
<p>Maybe the problems you consider to be exceptionally hard are just ones that merely require some dedication — and a doggedness to fix, come-what-may.</p>

      <title>Book Review: Utopia for Realists</title>
      <id>blog/utopia-for-realists/index.html</id>
      <link href='blog/utopia-for-realists/index.html'/>
      <published>2019-02-05T13:37:00Z</published>
      <updated>2019-02-05T13:37:00Z</updated>

      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
        <p>Rutger Bergman’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40876575-utopia-for-realists">Utopia for Realists</a> is a book whose primary thesis is that we should have a guaranteed minimum income (GMI).</p>
<p>I must admit, I was pretty sold on a guaranteed minimum income before reading this book. I hadn’t thought too much about it, besides the fact that lots of smart people I know say it’s a good idea, and that obviously we’re going to need a solution to what happens to humans after we automate away all of the jobs.</p>
<p>After reading this book, I am significantly less on-board with the idea.</p>
<p>What it boils down to is that Utopia for Realists isn’t very good. If these are the best arguments for a GMI, well… let’s hope that they’re not the best arguments for a GMI.</p>
<p>I can’t make up my mind on whether this book is <em>merely incompetent</em> or actively <em>dishonest.</em></p>
<p>For example, the book discusses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speenhamland_system">Speenhamland system</a>, which it describes as an early form of GMI, and then discusses a contemporary report which described it as a failed experiment. But then Utopia for Realists turns around with the sentence “more recent research has revealed that the Speenhamland system was actually a success.” A description of how the original study was supposedly flawed, but no citation to back it up. No reference to which “more recent research” reveals resounding success. There are lots of other citations in the book. Why not one here?</p>
<p>Utopia makes some other bold claims without backing them up; here’s a few that bothered me enough to mark them down:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Ultimately, the perfect, self-regulating market proved an illusion.”</li>
<li>“The historian Brian Steesland… emphasizes that, had Nixon’s plan gone ahead, the ramifications would have been huge… No longer would there be such a thing as the ‘deserving’ or ‘undeserving poor’ [no citation]”</li>
</ul>
<p>There was another time I wanted to check a source. The book makes a case for “giving housing/money to homeless people is cheaper than dealing with the consequences of not” via a case study. I’m willing to believe this; prevention <em>is</em> usually a better strategy than treatment. OK, fine. What I wanted to check was the cost breakdown; Utopia describes the project as costing $217 million, and being responsible for getting 6,500 people off of the streets over nine years. This struck me as being exorbitantly expensive, and I wanted to check their methodologies and math.</p>
<p>The given citation for this “unmitigated success” was to a random pdf on the Utrecht municipal website which doesn’t exist anymore. I didn’t try any harder than this to find the document. <a href="https://www.binnenlandsbestuur.nl/sociaal/achtergrond/achtergrond/rotterdam-haalt-daklozen-in-huis.127589.lynkx">The citation describing the experiment</a> points to a Dutch news site (that Google annoyingly refuses to translate) that looks more like an op-ed than anything official, but more damningly, doesn’t provide any links closer to the original source.</p>
<p>Bregman’s grasp of economics is pretty tenuous. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a certain perspective, [Bastiat] says, breaking a window sounds like a fine idea. “Imagine it costs six francs to repair the damage. And imagine that this creates a commercial gain of six francs—<em>I confess there’s no arguing with this reasoning.</em> The glazier comes along, does his work, and happily pockets six francs…” [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>No arguing?</em> Except that the glazier charges a fair price to replace the window, so he is only marginally better off after replacing the window, but the world <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK6VGP1B2Hw">has lost one window</a> and the owner is the worse-off for it.</p>
<p>He goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the manufacture of a fridge or a car, history lessons and doctor’s [sic] checkups can’t simply be made “more efficient.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is absurdly stupid. We’ve all taken classes that were long-winded and boring. The quality of a teacher has a huge bearing on how efficiently we learn from them. Websites like <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> are teaching entire university courses in a fraction of the time it would take to do through the usual channels. Doctors’ checkups <em>can</em> and <em>have</em> been made more efficient; it’s not an accident that doctors carry stethoscopes and have access to MRI machines.</p>
<p>But Bergman persists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the government is gobbling up a growing share of the economic pie… this phenomenon is now known as “Baumol’s cost disease,” basically says that prices in labor-intensive sectors such as healthcare and education increase faster than prices in sectors where most of the work can be more extensively automated… shouldn’t we be calling this a blessing, rather than a disease? After all, the more efficient our factories and our computers, the less efficient our healthcare and education need to be; that is, the more time we have left to attend to the old and infirm and to organize education on a more personal scale.</p>
<p>When you’re obsessed with efficient and productivity, it’s difficult to see the real value of education and care. Which is why so many politicians and taxpayers alike see only the costs. They don’t realize that the richer a country becomes the more it should be spending on teachers and doctors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No no no no no no. Cost disease doesn’t say “we spend too much on healthcare and education.” It says “<a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/09/considerations-on-cost-disease/">we spend too much on healthcare and education <em>on the margin.</em></a>” Which is to say that in less cost-diseased countries, spending an additional $1,000 will buy you a lot more than <em>the same additional</em> $1,000 in a more cost-diseased place.</p>
<p>Cost disease is the phenomenon that we’re <em>paying more to get less.</em> For example, Thailand has a booming dentistry industry among Australians because you can get the same quality work done for significantly less money. This isn’t “exploiting Thai workers” nor is it “taking jobs away from Australians”—it’s just Australian cost disease.</p>
<hr />
<p>A significantly smaller portion of the book describes the fifteen-hour workweek is an ideal one. Sure! Sounds good! But, Bergman says, “breaking the vicious cycle [of the 40 hour workweek] will require collective action—by companies, or better yet, by countries.”</p>
<p>I don’t get this one. If you want to work less than 40 hours, just… work less than 40 hours? Nobody is forcing you, except your spending habits. As it happens, life is actually pretty cheap. Find a small apartment, share it with some roommates, and eat a lot of rice. You can definitely manage to do it for less than $800 a month if you’re willing to shop around—and especially if you’re willing to move.</p>
<p>The secret is to just not spend money. That means stop eating lavish meals. Don’t get a pet. Don’t buy a vehicle. Stop drinking and smoking and give up whatever other vices you have that cost a bunch of money. It sounds dumb, but the secret to not working very much is to not need a lot of money.</p>
<p>And then use your extra time to <a href="/blog/become-a-programmer">learn how to do something valuable</a> so that you can work even less.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the end of the day, I get the strong impression that this book was <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/34XxbRFe54FycoCDw/the-bottom-line">written backwards</a>. Bergman very clearly believes in his cause, and has worked backwards trying to find arguments that support it—as evidenced by the sloppy citation work, numerous straw-men and gross-misunderstanding of the arguments against his point of view.</p>
<p>It’s a particularly bad sign when a book is <em>so bad that it makes people on your side agree with you less after reading it.</em> Give this one a miss, but if you’re looking for a <em>significantly</em> better resource championing MGI, look no further than <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/16/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia/">Slate Star Codex’s take on same</a>.</p>
