        <![CDATA[
        <p>Today I want to talk about goals — both those of my last year, and looking forward into 2021. I don’t really want to talk about the first part, but <em>I guess I have to.</em> They say that if you can’t remember the last time you failed something, you must not be trying hard enough. And by that metric, 2020 was a resounding success! I failed most of my goals! So let’s quickly recap, think about what went wrong, and then talk about Olympic swimming.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>What were my goals for last year? The big one was to finish my book <a href="https://algebradriven.design/">Algebra-Driven Design</a>, which happened and has been both a financial and critical success. Nice one, Sando!</p>
<p>I was also going to go through all of <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security">PortSwigger Web Academy</a>, which is an online sandbox for learning how to break into websites. I made it through all of the free lessons (some you need to buy specialized tools,) and found a genuine exploit in the wild on a Japanese-curry restaurant’s website. Victory!</p>
<p>Also I was going to exercise for 20 minutes a day. I think there were some weeks during lockdown in which I didn’t hit this target, but between swimming in the Andaman sea, skateboarding, riding a too-small bicycle, at-home swing-dancing lessons with Erin, a (very) brief foray into running, rock climbing, and eventually getting a gym membership, I’m counting this as a win. Though lack of explicit tracking my data puts an asterisk beside this one.</p>
<p>I wasn’t going to drink any alcohol in 2020 either. This one didn’t strictly happen, but in total I drank fewer than 15 beers, and had zero wine or spirits (but a little bailey’s on days that I found it hard to write.) I got drunk once, and it was for a good cause — my friend’s bachelor party. But importantly, alcohol is no longer a part of my life, and I’ve got a very healthy relationship these days. Occasionally I’ll feel like I want a beer, but when I get one, I’m never very happy about it and don’t end up finishing it.</p>
<p>So that’s the good stuff. Something I partially succeeded on was performing 2 hours of music. I played a 45 minute “concert” on my balcony in China town to a few vagrants and passersby, who clapped when I was done, so I’m counting in. But it’s less than half of what I’d wanted to do, and also I had a more “formal” setting in mind when I made the goal. <strong>C+.</strong></p>
<p>And uh, everything else went wrong. I was going to learn to love vegetables in 2020, and despite going vegetarian for a month, and a traumatizing French-onion soup incident, still do not love vegetables. I was going to compose 5 songs, learn a new programming language, volunteer for something, and only watch quality TV. Bad bad bad bad bad.</p>
<p>Also I was going to journal every week. Which stopped feeling so necessary once I had my life together. It would still come out when I had interpersonal things to work through, but all in all, I just didn’t need it as much as I had expected.</p>
<p>I was going to make a solid friend-group, and I hit the ground running when I returned from Thailand, ready to make that happen. Unfortunately, the GLOBAL PANDEMIC had other plans, and the exceptionally lawful denizens of my new home really weren’t willing to break the rules. I’m blaming my failure here on an act of god, moreso than anything I might have done.</p>
<p>Similarly, I was going to have set myself up in a strong community where I wanted to spend my next decade. While I moved somewhere, it’s been if not physically, at least spiritually, locked down the entire time. I have absolutely no idea if I like it here or not, because I haven’t really experienced it. But I made things happen with the love of my life, with whom I want to spend the rest of my life, so maybe that’s close enough.</p>
<p>So what went so horribly wrong? It’s tempting to blame it all on THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES, but that’s just not true. I mean it is, but it’s a cop out. What really went wrong, I think, is that I made a lot of non-SMART goals, that were output based, but came with no mechanism to ensure I stayed on top of them. And like, what does it even mean to “learn to love vegetables?” Idiotic play.</p>
<h2 id="the-mundanity-of-excellence">The Mundanity of Excellence</h2>
<p>Let’s change tack and talk about Olympic swimming for a bit.</p>
<p>One of my favorite papers of all time is <a href="http://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/hcd%3Aarticles-and-excerpts/Chambliss-MundanityOfExcellence.pdf">Chambliss’ <em>The Mundanity of Excellence: An Ethnographic Report on Stratification and Olympic Swimmers.</em></a> Chambliss spends a few years following competitive swimmers across all skill levels, and analyzes what differentiates competitors of different skill levels. Its key results are that skill levels are discretely stratified — a competitor “may consistently qualify for the Junior Nationals, but not for the Seniors” or “may swim at the Olympics, and never return to Junior Nationals.” The claim is that this is not the effect of quantitative changes, but that swimming at the Senior Nationals is <em>fundamentally different</em> than at the Junior Nationals. Which is to say, that Olympic swimmers aren’t <em>faster</em> than their local swim-meet analogues; they are swimming <em>completely differently.</em> The discrete stratification of a natural result of this; being physically more fluid-dynamic than your peers might be an advantage to help you win at one level, but that’s a micro-optimization that is too small to bump you between strata.</p>
<p>Moving between these layers of skill, Chambliss argues, requires qualitative changes. In the swimming example, kicking harder than other people is a quantitative change that won’t excel you to greatness; but kicking <em>differently</em> will. Experts aren’t just “better amateurs.”</p>
<p>If generalizable, this has important ramifications for becoming excellent at your skill of choice. Playing to your strengths will help in the short term, but resign you to doing more of what you already are doing. Improving areas in which you’re weak will be more fruitful, in that it will unlock other areas for improvement — things that you’re currently unaware of due to mitigating your weaknesses.</p>
<p>To be concrete, I’ve been playing guitar for like six years now. And I’m embarrassingly bad at it for having played that long. For the vast majority of that time I didn’t really know what I was doing; I’d look up chords for a song I liked, ensure that it didn’t have any scary-looking ones, and then memorize that and strum the chords out whenever I had a guitar around. Often I chose ballad-type songs that were heavily singing-focused, so I could rely on being able to sing as a crutch for my bad guitar playing.</p>
<p>It sorta worked. I was “fine” at guitar. I had a few songs I could pull out and impress girls with. But I wasn’t good by any measure.</p>
<p>But then last year, someone played me a song by finger-picking her way through it. It was the first time I’d ever <em>seen someone do that.</em> It sounded really good, and it looked easy. So I spent the next week practicing that, and by god, my guitar playing got 10x better.</p>
<p>Two weeks after that, I called my friend Rory and we chatted about music for a while. I marveled to him about my newfound skills, and he showed me how barre chords are laid out on the fretboard. Not only that they are, but <em>what the pattern is.</em> It was a qualitatively different way of thinking about the fretboard, about learning patterns and landmarks, rather than trying to memorize what letter goes in every single one of the little boxes. So I studied and internalized this too. And again, my guitar playing got 10x better.</p>
<p>Three weeks is about 1% of the time I’ve spent playing guitar. Seeing a 100x skill improvement in such a short time, perfectly correlated with <em>trying new things</em> is good evidence in favor of Chambliss.</p>
<p>I see this a lot in programming too. There’s a stupid meme going around about whether some programmers are 10x better than the average. The masses shout “no,” but they’re wrong. I’m not sure if this is self-delusion or simply a selection bias, but the best programmers I know are easily 1000x better than the average. Maybe not in terms of <em>productivity,</em> but certainly in terms of problem solving. The best programmers aren’t people who have necessarily been doing it longer; they’re people who have been systematically tackling hard problems, and learning new tools, and most importantly, (gasp!) learning the underlying theory.</p>
<p>This is by no means a dig at the average programmers, nor an assessment of their worth. Most of the world’s problems are indeed <a href="/blog/brilliance">boring and require more tediousness than anything else.</a> Just because we have Dostoevsky doesn’t mean we don’t also need E. L. James — but it would be a mistake to say that these are two authors of the same caliber.</p>
<p>On this topic, however, Chambliss has some good news. Qualitative stratification is so important that it absolutely dwarfs the effect of “natural talent” or “hard work.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The top swimming coaches in America fall into the same prejudice, attributing success often to “hard work” or “talent.” Since they habitually, unreflectively, live at the top level (having spent almost their entire coaching career there), they never see what creates the differences between levels. The fact is, quantitative changes do bring success-but only within levels of the sport. 12 Doing more of the same pays off, but only in very limited, locally visible ways. One can achieve a slight advantage over peers by doing more without changing the quality of what is done.</p>
<p>Having seen that “more is better” within local situations, we tend to extrapolate. If I work this hard to get to my level, how hard must Olympic swimmers work? If I sacrifice this much to qualify for the State Championships, how much must they sacrifice? We believe, extrapolating from what we learn about success at our own level, that they must work unbelievably hard, must feel incredible pressure, must sacrifice more and more to become successful. Assuming implicitly that stratification in sports is continuous rather than discrete (that the differences are quantitative) we believe that top athletes do unbelievable things. In short, we believe that they must be superhuman.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="looking-forwards">Looking Forwards</h2>
<p>So what’s the takeaway here? Systematically try new things when practicing. I made a list the other day of potential interventions for all of my hobbies — programming, electronics, math, fitness, music — and also just in how I conduct myself in my relationships and in life more generally. In <em>less than ten minutes,</em> I had at least five things for each activity, things that it was completely self-evident that adopting these things would drastically improve my performance. And it wasn’t even hard to come up with. My brain <em>already knew</em> all the stuff I should have been doing all along. It just felt like hard work, so I didn’t even try.</p>
<p>The trick, I think, is to prioritize the trying of new things over the supposed benefits they’ll bring. It’s much easier to fuck around on guitar than it is to DO EXERCISES THAT YOU DON’T WANT TO BUT KNOW WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER GUITAR PLAYER. Even though these two activities are the same thing. That’s not to say I’m allowed to slack off in my practice of these things, but I’m already good at that. What I’m not good at is introducing new ideas into my practice routine, which systematic diversification will help with.</p>
<p>So that’s my goal for 2021 — to “do things differently.” I’ve put together a spreadsheet that I can pull up with a single keystroke, and <em>solemnly swear</em> to update it every day with one thing that I did differently. There are no other restrictions here, I trust that I’ll move in the right direction if I take a step everyday. What a SMART goal.</p>
<p>Oh, and also, I’m going to stop watching pornography. It lowers my libido and makes me feel bad. So why do it? Great question. To keep myself accountable here, I am pre-committing to publicly post a link to any pornography I consume in 2021. That would be embarrassing as heck. If failure is really expensive, you simply won’t fail. But it’s scary! I’m tracking this on my spreadsheet as well.</p>
<p>So those are my goals! Here’s to a much better year than the last.</p>

        <![CDATA[
        <h2 id="southeast-asia">Southeast Asia</h2>
<p>What a weird year 2020 has been. It started in Bangkok, having gone all the way down to the busiest place I’ve ever been in my entire life to see some fireworks. And then, when we got there 10 minutes before the fireworks, we somehow decided to not go watch them. Whoops.</p>
<p>After one of the most amazing jazz concerts of my life to see Tran Manh Tuan, Natalia and I then headed to Saigon, where we spent a week bickering and went on a truly awful walking tour of the city. N said she hated cities, so we took a 19 hour train ride into the rural middle of Vietnam. And promptly promptly broke up when we got there. Somehow she convinced me to pay for her flight out of the country. As far as getting rid of exes, $60 isn’t such a bad deal, but I think she got the better end of it.</p>
<p>So I trundled back to Koh Lanta, the first place since Denver to felt like home. I was there for about two months, having found a villa apartment, and hanging out at the <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Hub-of-Joys/Koh-Lanta/273529">Hub of Joys</a> — an amazing hostel on the island. I’d chosen the apartment (furnished!) because it came with a kitchen and I was feeling optimistic about cooking, despite not knowing how, not having a grocery store, and living in a country where a restaurant meal will set you back less $1. The extremely sassy manager of the apartments gave me a tour of the place, and it was exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>My evenings were spent at the Hub, schmoozing with new people on the daily. For whatever reason, the Hub mainly attracts young, single, German women, so between that and nightly karaoke, I was pretty occupied. The day I was supposed to take possession of my apartment, I’d convinced one such German woman to come check it out with me. When we got there, it wasn’t at all the place the sassy manager had shown me! Instead of a glorious king-sized bed with an ocean view, I was instead saddled with five(!) single beds. The German woman wasn’t impressed, and went home.</p>
<p>After complaining to the sassy manager, two Thai men came <em>running</em> up the hill carrying a giant mattress. I think it might have been a show to make me feel bad, but knowing that didn’t make it feel less bad. While we waited for the staff to make a new bedroom right before my eyes. It happened impressively fast, but it was still slow as hell. The sassy manager hung out the whole time, and asked me to play a song on the guitar for her. I sang the first thing that came to mind, and she said “oh, a love song? no thanks” — it wasn’t — and we spent the rest of the time in uncomfortable silence.</p>
<p>My neighbors eventually came around to say hi. They were grandparents from Sweden, and were very suspicious of this young man who had come to live in their community. They’d somehow heard about the fuss I made about having a kitchen, and would regularly check up on me to see if I’d been using it.</p>
<p>In the mornings, I’d work on writing <a href="https://algebradriven.design/">my book.</a> The afternoons were spent swimming, lounging around on the beach, and playing guitar. And in the evening, back to the Hub to hone my social skills and inevitably try to persuade Germans to come to karaoke. It didn’t often work, but when it did, great nights always followed.</p>
<p>What a life of luxury I led.</p>
<p>After a few weeks of this, it came to my attention that I was <em>happy.</em> Ask anyone; that’s not a feeling I’m particularly familiar with. That’s not to say I’m depressed or sad or anything. My life is excellent, but I’d never really <em>felt</em> it before, viscerally. Partly it was just unwinding; after <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/erdos/">living on couches for four months</a> and <a href="https://sandymaguire.me/blog/burnout/">breaking down</a>, I really needed some “me” time. But also, for the first time in my life, I noticed how good I had become, socially.</p>
<p>For the vast majority of my life, I’d been a shy kid, who wasn’t particularly good at talking to new people, or dealing with social situations. I’d turned to alcohol as a crutch when I hit 19, but ten years later was now sober and, I realized, completely in control of social encounters. I could organize groups, change the energy level of the room, and get shy people engaged and opened-up. I could reliably get into deep, interesting conversations with people. And, amazingly to 16-year-old me, had women throwing themselves at me.</p>
<p>Somehow, I’d gotten really good at social situations, and hadn’t noticed it until early February. I think until then, I had been carrying around the memory of <em>the person I used to be,</em> while thinking it still applied. Shedding that false identity is the most powerful experience I’ve ever had. Funny that I needed to run to the other side of the world and play guitar and flirt with German girls in order to make that happen — it’s not exactly the hero’s journey.</p>
<p>Of the many incredible people I met and spent tie with, some exceptional ones were Liam, Tobi, Lucie and Katha — with whom I put more trust than I was comfortable, and was richly rewarded in the resulting interactions. I love you all, for our discussions about overthrowing governments, for our impromptu trip to Krabi Town, for using my head as a jenga platform, and just for your intellectual and emotional companionship.</p>
<p>In February, my old friend and occasional lover Erin came to visit. There are no words to describe the joy I experienced as she walked across the hotel lobby to come say hi. The next ten days were a flurry of terrible tourist islands, non-air-conditioned bungalows, witnessing a child bride be married off, never-ending intellectual discussions. Oh, and I kicked a sea urchin at some point, so also hobbling around and spending hours soaking my toes in vinegar held in an empty cup-noodles container.</p>
<p>After too many days on Koh Lipe, we decided to leave, and I brought Erin back to Koh Lanta. We got some excellent khao soi, some iffy sushi, and the karaoke performance of a lifetime. I introduced her to my Thai hostel family. Tong and Noisy knew there was something special about the way Erin and I felt about each other, and they presented us with chop sticks on our final goodbye — apparently a Thai wedding tradition. Portent.</p>
<p>Erin sugared us with fancy hotel rooms when we went to Phuket, but was unable to deal with it due to getting probably-covid. We’re not sure what it was exactly, but she was out of commission for a few days and we were both genuinely — though momentarily — concerned she might die. But she didn’t! And instead we shared a cab to the airport, where she headed back to Canada, and I made my way to Chiang Mai.</p>
<p>Chiang Mai was where my previous transformation happened, back in 2017, when I decided to <a href="https://sandymaguire.me/blog/reaching-climbing/">quit my job and retire.</a> Unfortunately, I came to the conclusion that it was the circumstances (and more importantly, the people) who made Chiang Mai magical the last time around. Without Sam, Job and Dan, the place just wasn’t the same. My week in Chiang Mai was lonely, but I did make some geo-tagging stickers of my face that I distributed to the random travelers I met. To date, they’ve been scanned in 18 different cities across the globe, and I still have like 500 in my closet to put up when the world reopens.</p>
<p>My Thai visa was about to expire, so my plan was to head to Korea and then to Japan. But COVID struck in full force, and both countries were closed to me. Due to lots of unsolicited advice from back home, I was convinced to return to Canada, but still had a week to kill. I spent it in a quiet hostel in Bangkok on Erin’s recommendation where I met some cute Thai nurses whom I liked (“you are very strong and handsome boy”), and a tech-bro-startup-dude that I didn’t. That week I made some incredible breakthroughs on my book, eventually stumbling across the eventual linchpin of the final product.</p>
<p>While I was there, I discovered a love for Japanese curry, and also discovered my first real security vulnerability in the website for Japanese curry. Mark one of my yearly goals off!</p>
<p>I ran into my ex-girlfriend Dana in Bangkok, who had been traveling continuously since we’d broken up (on good terms) in 2017. It was great to see her, and we had a few fun days bopping around the city and catching up. I was headed for the Canadian winter in two days, and she helped me put together a last-minute, weather-appropriate outfit for it.</p>
<h2 id="getting-settled">Getting Settled</h2>
<p>March 9th, and I whooshed back to Canada. I got into the country a few hours before they started telling people to self-quarantine at the border, so I get off scot free. The next few days were spent with my friend Andrew, who was kind enough to host a potentially deadly human on his couch. That night we got a few of the lads together and witnessed the genesis of the spectacular ∞-groupoid chat. I was <a href="https://sandymaguire.me/blog/best-place-to-live/">en-route for Victoria</a> During my stay, I convinced Andrew to move to Victoria with me, and we hit the island.</p>
<p>Victoria. My new home. But I didn’t yet have a place to live, so I hit the only hostel in town that was still open — the unfortunately named Hostelling Internation Victoria. And my god did HIV live up to its name. Without a doubt, it was the worst hostel I’ve ever stayed at. My dorm was full of 40 men, with the exact smell you’d expect from a dorm full of 40 semi-homeless men. There were bed-bugs, no community vibe whatsoever, and it was cold as shit. I was supposed to stay 14 days but only managed two; it was the man snoring at a record 78dB — louder than a vacuum cleaner. I know, because I measured it.</p>
<p>Instead I found a room in a shared airbnb apartment, run by some chill people. It would have been fine, but they smoked a loooot of weed, which I find exceptionally distracting. Although they didn’t say anything, I could tell they were uncomfortable having me there during the days of our GLOBAL PANDEMIC. It was nice base of operations while I recovered from the HIV, but it was time to move on and find a place of my own. Before I took off, my hosts set me up on a blind date because, and I quote, “you both like candy.” Needless to say, the date didn’t go well, nor was it helped by her grandfather dying earlier in the day.</p>
<p>I’d bought a skateboard since moving to Victoria, and the early days of the lockdown were amazing. There were no cars on the road, so I moved house by skating down the middle of the street, tugging my roller suitcase behind me. Sandy “King of the Road” Maguire.</p>
<p>What followed was an endless procession of airbnbs. There was a weird executive suite. A loft apartment with bad sound-proofing where all of the neighbors would complain if you had the audacity to go up to your loft. The very Chinese apartment, owned by a white man and his latina wife. I stayed at the last of these for a month, and used the opportunity to buy a piano as something to help keep me sane. I played an hour-long concert on my balcony, to the thunderous applause of three homeless people and one racist man.</p>
<p>Erin coincidentally lives in Victoria — so we started hanging out. Our history has been a long, twisted one, going back seven years. In all that time, we’d been interested in one another, but never simultaneously single and co-located. Possibly aided by the GLOBAL PANDEMIC, we ended up spending a lot of time together and, despite our best efforts, couldn’t manage to stay apart.</p>
<p>I finally found an apartment — unfurnished — at a bit of a steal; the landlord clearly couldn’t afford the mortgage, so I picked it up at well below rental prices. The neighborhood seemed really nice, lots of food options, a grocery store, a jazz bar, but everything was closed due to the GLOBAL PANDEMIC. Erin helped me move my one suitcase and piano across town on foot, and we spent a romantic evening on the floor of my empty apartment, eating burgers and singlehandedly keeping the Canadian potato farmers in business.</p>
<p>With an apartment lined up, all that was left were the necessities of modern living: furniture, a bed, wifi and a phone so I could buzz people into the building. Furniture was surprisingly easy; IKEA just dropped it off and I spent a few days pounding dowels, twirling Allen keys, and watching Jackie Chan movies. But the other three? <em>Very challenging.</em></p>
<p>All of the mattress stores were closed, which meant I was resigned to the dreaded bed-in-a-box internet shopping experience. After what felt like 10 hours of doing MATTRESS-RELATED RESEARCH, learning about what sort of sleeper I was, and where my sleep pressure points were, and what sort of hardness sleepers like me should, and what my pillow shams said about me as a person, I was ready to <em>do shopping.</em> I splurged and bought the best bed for me according to the internet. But supply chains were backed up, so it got lost in the mail. And then they kept trying to deliver it at 8 in the morning, but because of the combination of <em>not having a phone to buzz them in</em> (a forthcoming story in this saga) and <em>not sleeping at the apartment because I didn’t have a bed there,</em> they failed to deliver it for an additional four days. Let me tell you, after two weeks of sleeping on floors and couches, nothing has ever felt better than taking that damn mattress of it its box. Not even the realization that my research was for naught and it was ridiculously uncomfortable could sully my spirits.</p>
<p>Throughout all of this time, I didn’t even have internet to help. I’d called the internet people well in advance, but you know how they are. They can never show for a week. When the guy did, he hooked up some cables in the control room, and told me to go plug in the modem and see if it worked. Unfortunately the modem hadn’t yet arrived in the mail, so he left, assuming it would just work. The delivery company tried to deliver the modem, but <em>because my phone didn’t work</em> (still forthcoming,) they decided that instead of leaving it, they should drive it 100km away and leave a note telling me to pick it up at my earliest convenience. There was no “we will attempt redelivery” info, nor was there a website, nor did they actually say where they were holding my package. They didn’t pick up the phone for 45 minutes when I called on a borrowed phone.</p>
<p>Thankfully the telco <em>did</em> pick up the phone, and I berated them until someone bit the bullet and waited on hold for two hours to get in touch with the delivery company. When my modem finally arrived, it didn’t just work. Apparently my apartment wasn’t in fact wired for ADSL, but the modem didn’t come with a cable, so I had to run across town to pick one up before I could learn that. Tech support then refused to help me until I tried a different cable, so I had to go back across town to get <em>another</em> cable. It also didn’t work. The telco said they could send a guy in a week, but he’d probably have to cut holes in the wall to install it. Yeah right, pull the other one. It has bells on it.</p>
<p>So I called around, and finally found a cable reseller in town. Their office was a five minute walk away, but due to the GLOBAL PANDEMIC, I wasn’t allowed to go pick up a modem from them. Instead they’d have to mail one. Another week of waiting, and, guess what! It’s a lemon! For christ’s sake. Two excruciating hours on the phone with tech support where they ask me if I was <em>sure</em> that I’d turned it on. And that I’d plugged it in. Oh, and are you POSITIVE that it’s turned on? Maybe try wiggling the cable. Eventually I convinced them to send another modem. Thankfully there were no delivery issues this time, and it worked the first time I plugged it in.</p>
<p>And during this whole ordeal, I was trying to get a cheap cellphone, just something that the front door of my building could call to get buzzed in. But all of the phone companies were closed due to the GLOBAL PANDEMIC. “Did you know that most problems can be solved at our website?” Not this one, and even if it were, not without internet, you bastards. Eventually they opened up in person, so I biked across town to wait outside for an hour while they allowed <em>one person maximum</em> into the store. I convinced them no thank you, I wouldn’t like the latest iphone. Yes, that’s right, a $10 plan is sufficient. No, I don’t need data with that. The man looked dejected, but took my credit card, and sent me on my way. Blissfully, the phone worked without any issues.</p>
<p>I caved temporarily on the data front while I sat in my unfurnished, unconnected apartment, with the rest of the world closed, while I waited for all of the problems in my life to get ironed out. But I couldn’t add the data plan, because they couldn’t charge my credit card. This was mysterious; the card was fine. I had used it to buy the phone originally, it wasn’t blocked, and I could still use it to make purchases elsewhere. It turns out the telco doesn’t know the difference between billing and mailing addresses, and <em>always assume</em> that those are the same thing. But my billing address was still in America, and for whatever idiotic reason, their online system wouldn’t let you fill in an American postal code. So, they could accept my money in person, but the online system couldn’t handle it. After an hour talking to escalating tiers of managers, the eventual suggestion was to “change my billing address.” Thanks so much, guys. I don’t think this one ever got sorted out.</p>
<p>I’m sure the system works really well when you’re all set up, but MY GOD things shouldn’t have been this hard.</p>
<h2 id="routine-life">Routine Life</h2>
<p>In late April(?), Erin and I decided to “go steady.” We were already inseparable, but this made it official. Out of all the marvelous things that happened in 2020, this event tops the charts.</p>
<p>Now that I was back in Canada, I decided to go visit my parents, who lived only a breezy eight hours’ drive away. It sounds crazy, but that’s pretty damn proximate for Canada. I rented a car, and went up for a week. It was great to see them, but I left as a firm believer that familial relationships are much better with some distance. While I was there, I spent a few hours cutting and sanding styrofoam that I eventually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdkyGDqU7xA">turned into homemade speakers.</a> This was the beginning of what turned out to be quite an active year technically and electronically for me.</p>
<p>The rest of the summer passed without much ceremony. My cousins moved to town, and their parents followed them, and <em>their</em> daughter and fiance followed <em>them,</em> so all of a sudden I had lots of family in town. However, in SUCH UNCERTAIN TIMES, due to the GLOBAL PANDEMIC, we didn’t see much of one another. In fact, I didn’t see much of anyone. Of the fifteen people I knew in town, only one of them was willing to hang out with me with any sort of regular cadence (thanks Nash! you’re dope!) The others, whether it be due to GLOBAL PANDEMIC, social anxiety, or maybe just not liking me, refused.</p>
<p>In an attempt to stay social, I started calling old people from my life whom I’d really liked. At one point I was averaging over 20 hours of calls a week, It was fun reconnecting with great people. Some calls didn’t go so well, but others — like with Ehsaan — we went for five hours straight. After two weeks or so of this, I burned out on social activity, and curled up, putting the same amount of energy into writing a book. But this wasn’t the end of my social issues for the year.</p>
<p>It came to a head when I attempted to throw a joint house-warming/birthday party for myself, after extreme social isolation for five months. All I wanted was for my friends to come hang out with me. Only two people RSVP’d. It was one of the worst feelings of my life. Instead, Erin and my cousins took me out for korean BBQ — <em>more meat than our bodies had room for.</em> A nice consolation prize.</p>
<p>The birthday marked the beginning of my third decade. To celebrate, I decided to <em>finally</em> delete my Facebook account. Not just stop posting, like I’d done for the last year, but to actually delete the account and all of its associated data. At one point in my life I truly loved Facebook, but those days are no more. I haven’t regretted it, and it wasn’t hard for more than three days. Strongly recommended. I switched to Signal, updated everyone I cared to stay in touch with about my new info, and took the plunge. The result is that I talk to fewer people, but the ones I do stay in touch with are the people I really want to stay in touch with. Good trade.</p>
<p>To do a bit of time travel, in July, Erin and I and another couple went to see a band. Live music! Joyous occasion! In retrospect I don’t think the performance was amazing, but the circumstances of <em>being out in the world</em> and <em>hearing music</em> was enough to make any event memorable. I spent the entire show watching the bass player, and in particular, noticing both how good he sounded, and how little work he seemed to be doing. My infrequent musical gatherings always had me unpromptedly ending up playing a bass line on piano, which never really worked out. Combined with the fact that I wanted to play more music with people, and that everybody needs a bass player, the solution to both problems was obvious. The day after I went to buy a bass guitar (giant scale!) and an amp, and walk the hour home with them. Uncomfortable, but worth it.</p>
<p>On September 1st, I finished writing <a href="https://algebradriven.design/">my second book.</a> Taking an uncomfortable action, I decided to reach out to one of the pivotal researchers in the field, and ask him to write a foreword. This man is not only the creator of some core pieces of technology used in the book, he’s also a personal hero of mine, and approaching him was scary as hell. But he turned out to be super cool, and agreed to write the foreword so long as I gave him a few weeks of lead time. He returned with a beautifully-written foreword on September 10th, and having received it, my book immediately started sales. The response has been overwhelmingly positive, and the software I write has dramatically changed for the better. Thanks to everyone who’s helped support me throughout the writing process; each and every one of you is fantastic.</p>
<p>The rest of September was spent quietly, taking some time for myself. The book took a year to write, so it was nice to not have an overwhelming locus for my attention. But I couldn’t rest on my laurels, so I spent the month as a vegetarian. Just to try it, you understand. The goal was to learn to love vegetables, but what actually happened was that I just ate a lot of broccoli and tofu. Erin and I signed up for the gym, started going regularly, and in my case, started looking really good (she already did!)</p>
<p>Or maybe the vegetarian thing was in July. It’s hard to keep track sometimes.</p>
<p>October (or maybe September) was thankfully the end of being vegetarian, so on a whim, I decided to try being keto instead. I’m not much of a planner, so I sorta just dived in, eating lots of cauliflower and ground beef for the first two weeks. It was fine, until it wasn’t. I’m not convinced I really got into ketosis at any point, but I sure got the keto flu a lot, so maybe that was me going in and out of ketosis lots of times. Under that lens, my weird food experiment was <em>wildly</em> successful — I entered ketosis something like five times in a month!!</p>
<p>During my <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/erdos/">Erdos project</a>, James King had the idea of a new way to write software. It’s an amazing idea and has always stuck in my mind. I made some progress towards it last year, but the underling infrastructure simply wasn’t ready for the sorts of things we had in mind. But in October, I read a blog post that suggested the technology was now ready for what we had in mind. I enlisted the help of my friend Reed, and we went heads down. By the end of the month, we had a working <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/towards-tactics/">tactics plugin</a> for the Haskell language server, It’s now out in the hands of a few thousand people, and I hear a few times a week how much people love it.</p>
<p>My time lines are all screwy from here on out. During my month of keto, I realized my energy levels had completely leveled out. I used to take a giant nap every afternoon, thinking that I just got tired in the afternoon. But this didn’t happen while on keto. What was happening in fact was I was experiencing a massive sugar crash, and weathered it out by taking a nap. No sugar, no crash, no naps. So I spent a month just not eating sugar. It was amazing how good I felt, though I did have nightly dreams of skittles. These days I’m back on the sugar, but only in the evening, when I want to crash anyway.</p>
<p>I also bought a 3D printer sometime around here. It was an impulse purchase, but I thought it would be fun to have a way of turning software ideas into reality. That’s always been my biggest qualm with software: it’s hard to show normies what it is you do. There are no tangible products of an elegant algorithm other than the algorithm itself, which most people simply <em>can’t</em> appreciate. Thankfully my ego and vanity are both huge so I can appreciate it for them for me, but all in all, it’s been really cool to be able to make physical things.</p>
<p>In November I decided to take on a hard project and <a href="https://sandymaguire.me/blog/mastery-skateboard/">make a self-balancing skateboard.</a> I failed pretty miserably on this front, but in my defense, it’s now late December and I still haven’t received the GIANT SELF-DRIVING WHEEL that is a linchpin in the project. If I were truly dedicated to the idea, I probably could have made one myself, but I wasn’t and I didn’t. I still plan to build this thing, but I’m hoping the parts will come in first.</p>
<p>For December, I decided to make a roomba for Erin. It was my first true foray into CAD, and I immediately realized that I hated all of the CAD software. Of course, there’s a nascent Haskell library for doing CAD, so I picked that up and started trying to model the roomba. It was a much better experience than any of the other software, but it still crashed all the time. I made friends with the maintainer, and have spent a good chunk of my waking time since then contributing to the project with whatever things I find in the course of making the roomba.</p>
<p>Getting the robot to suck has been a surprisingly challenge; did you know not all fans are made equal? I think I bought three or four before I found one that does the job, and then I immediately wasted it by designing a bad intake system. Turns out fans move a constant volume of air, not a constant mass, and so, contrary to first thought, you actually lose a lot of suction if you have internally small pipe cross-sections. The software for the roomba was pretty trivial, and he wanders around the house and doesn’t bump into things. It’s cute to watch. The goal was to have him finished for 2021, but a few of the last parts I need will arrive in January.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s been a spectacular year. I’m feeling truly self-actualized; like the principled teenage-me, but with the confidence I was <em>sorely</em> lacking. I learned a lot of new skills, from security pen-testing, to algebra-driven design, to electronics and fan design, to the acoustics of what you want in a speaker. I wrote an excellent book, and nailed a few cool software projects. I’ve been sober for a year. I started dating the love of my life, and have set a lot of serious relationship milestone records with her.</p>
<p>In the words of Moist — <em>I love my life; it’s getting better every day.</em></p>

      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
        <p>Some time ago, I deleted Facebook. Maybe it was for New Years? Maybe not — it turns out to not have been a very memorable affair. At the time, I had set up an alternative messaging platform whose philosophy I agreed with, and gave my contact information to the few people I actively stayed in contact with. For the most part, it’s been a smooth transition.</p>
<p>But something I’ve realized since then is that this strategy ignores the long tail of friendship. It doesn’t help me stay in touch with my coworkers from a few jobs back, nor from old classmates, nor my downstairs neighbor when I was 22. I mean, it’s not really a problem; these aren’t people I need to contact frequently. But I have a habit of reaching out to people whenever I think of them; it’s a nice way to reacquaint with cool people from the past.</p>
<p>Facebook is really good at these sorts of interactions. But Facebook isn’t free. It comes with the twenty thousand of some of the world’s smartest engineers trying working full-time to maximize the amount of time you spend on the platform. Its clustering algorithms are good at aggressively polarizing people and turning everyone into an extremist. Messenger and events are really the only good parts of Facebook. And until recently, the fact that you could expect everyone to have an account; although there’s been a marked engagement exodus of people under 50.</p>
<p>What Facebook is really good at is the network effect. But the rest of the platform is such an overwhelmingly bad experience that it spoils the broth. Somehow we’d all find ourselves scrolling through the newsfeed for the tenth time that day, seeing no new content, but <em>desperately hoping</em> for something new we could “like.”</p>
<p>And besides. I don’t really need instant messaging with my old colleague who now lives in India. We probably are never awake at the same time. What I really need from Facebook is a convenient way of contacting him.</p>
<p>Contrast all of this to LinkedIn. Maybe five years ago, LinkedIn was doing absolutely everything in its power to copy the Facebook recipe for success. They completely plagiarized the layout, although they were careful to make the blue of their design slightly more blue. After all, you need to differentiate yourself somehow! They stole the newsfeed, and added likes and reactions. But it never really worked. The content on LinkedIn doesn’t have the fake veneer of “important life events from people you care about.” It’s just virtue signaling about jobs and shit. I’ve <em>tried</em> to mindlessly scroll on LinkedIn, and I just don’t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Here’s the catch. LinkedIn has the same network effects Facebook does. Everybody is on LinkedIn — probably more of the people in my real life than on Facebook — if for no other reason than people forget that they have a LinkedIn account and so they don’t delete it. Unless you’re actively hunting for a job, nobody checks LinkedIn more than once a month.</p>
<p>By virtue of being so terrible, I think LinkedIn might actually be the perfect social network. We’re all on it, but we don’t engage with it. It’s a reliable place to find people I want to reconnect with. But by virtue of it being a “reconnect,” there is no need for immediacy in this. So I’ll send a message to someone on LinkedIn, and on average, they’ll reply in about two weeks. Which I’ll see two weeks after that. There is enough bandwidth here to negotiate a faster means of communication, but reconnecting with a school mate just doesn’t necessitate anything faster than pen pals.</p>
<p>And the (bad) network effect here is self-reinforcing. Because people take so long to reply on LinkedIn, I have no incentive to check it often. Which makes me take a long time to reply, and a) keeps the mean response tie high, and therefore b) keeps LinkedIn a terrible platform. And because it’s a terrible platform in terms of experience, it’s actually an excellent social media network. It sounds paradoxical, but the thing I like about LinkedIn is how non-addictive it is by virtue of being shitty.</p>
<p>Worse is better.</p>

        <h2 id="the-project">The Project</h2>
<p>Now that Algebra-Driven Design is done, I’ve been looking to branch out of my traditional skill-set. With the exception of a little break at the end of last year, I’ve been programming continuously since 2003, and have gotten pretty good in that space. For the last five years, learning Haskell has been my primary intellectual endeavor, but these days I feel like I’ve learned about as much as it has to teach me. It’s time to tackle something new.</p>
<p>Looking for inspiration, I came across the wonderful <a href="https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch">Max Deutsch</a>, whose <a href="https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch/m2m-day-1-completing-12-ridiculously-hard-challenges-in-12-months-9843700c741f">Month to Master</a> project had him pick up and conquer one ridiculously difficult project per month. These weren’t things like “learn to play Wonderwall,” but were “learn to draw photo-realistic self-portraits” and “build a self-driving car.” At the beginning of each month he’d introduce the project, and then write daily microblogs describing the day’s progress. I love this idea, and have decided I’m going to follow in Max’s footsteps and aggressively tackle my own exciting projects.</p>
<p>Today, November 1, 2020, is the first day of the project. My intention for November is to <em>build a self-balancing, one-wheel skateboard.</em> I used to have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNqOU4jx62I">OneWheel</a>, which was the most fun sport I’ve ever engaged in. When I <a href="/blog/burnout/">ran away from Ottawa</a>, I left it behind, and have regretted it ever since. But these bastards are expensive, and, having fixed it myself a few times, not overwhelmingly complicated.</p>
<p>I have no idea how to build such a thing, but I’m confident I can figure it out in a month. I built some lego robots in university, and once soldered together a clock, but that’s the extent of my hardware knowledge.</p>
<p>My plan is to build a model-scale skateboard, in order to test my engineering prowess, and ensure I have sufficient understanding of the control systems. Doing it with full-sized hardware is a stretch-goal, though the parts are quite expensive, so I’d like some assurance that I’m on the right path before investing in them. If the month ends with only a robust, working scale prototype, I’ll consider it a success if the only hurdle towards productionizing is one of economics.</p>
<p>I’m off to get started. Will report back, editing this post, with my progress each day.</p>
<h3 id="section">2020-11-01</h3>
<p>Today was less productive than I was expecting. I found a tutorial on <a href="https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-based-self-balancing-robot">making a self-balancing robot</a>, and started working on it. I’ve got the electronics prototyped out, but when 3D printing the chassis, my printer started running into extruder problems. (I think) I’ve got that sorted out now, and tried to print the chassis again; this time somehow my bed had gotten out level, making the print extremely stuck to the print bed. When wrestling it off, the PLA snapped. I’m trying again with a re-calibrated, hopefully better-extruding system, but the chassis is a four hour print. If I don’t have a sturdy piece by lunch tomorrow, I’m going to macguyver something together out of cardboard and hot glue.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">2020-11-02</h3>
<p>My recalibrated 3D prints went well; I seem to have solved the brittleness and adhesion problems. But I didn’t realize the pieces needed to be bolted together. Three trips to different hardware stores and two hours later, I hadn’t managed to find the right bolts. I knew I needed 3mm diameter bolts, but they don’t sell them by diameter. Instead they have meaningless designations like #7, #6 and especially confusingly, #6-32. The #6-32s were the smallest I could find, so I picked those up. But they’re actually 4.5mm, which is TOO BIG. Covid has the industrial supply store closed, so if I want to find these pieces locally, it’s going to take a minimum of two days. Instead I bought a big collection of random bolts on Amazon and paid the express delivery fee to have them before end of tomorrow.</p>
<p>I was vaguely aware of this eventuality; that building things in meat-space require parts that I can’t just magic up by downloading a library. I <em>knew</em> this, but I didn’t <em>feel</em> it until now.</p>
<p>Feeling underwhelmed by my progress, I familiarized myself with the PID controller libraries, and how my accelerometer works at a high level. I think I have a good understanding of these thins, and verified it by seeing that the PID equations can be implemented in 6 lines of Haskell. I also confirmed that my Arduino environment and build-chain is working, so that I’m ready to go as soon as tomorrow’s chassis is built. Disappointing day, though.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">2020-11-03</h3>
<p>My partner last night asked “why didn’t you just 3D print some bolts?” Gotta admit, that idea never occurred to me. Apparently I’m not yet used to having a mini factory in my house. So I tried that this morning, but my tolerances aren’t good enough, and the resulting nuts didn’t thread successfully. Thankfully my Amazon delivery happened in the morning, so I set back to building.</p>
<p>My new bolts are the right diameter, but are TOO SHORT for what I need them to do. Fuck. So I just started hot-gluing things, and that worked well enough. A careful hour later (the PLA chassis still feels very brittle), I had everything assembled, hot-glued, rewired, and soldered together. Time to get to balancing.</p>
<p>Some combination of “bad tutorial” and “bad engineer following said tutorial” resulted in me not calibrating the accelerometer while it’s on flat ground, so instead I just tried to balance the robot and run the calibration there. I have no idea how important this step is, but it’s something I’ll do when working on my skateboard proper.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes of tuning parameters, I got the robot balancing somewhat well. I’d accidentally soldered the drive motors backwards, so the first time around it would be actively trying to fall over. Whoops. Thankfully this was easy to fix in software. When everything was turning in the right direction, I found that my wheels stopped spinning when the desired delta got too big. Suspect: too low amperage on my batteries. Something to investigate tomorrow.</p>
<p>Also! I only fastened down the accelerometer with a single bolt (the chassis print apparently didn’t have a plan for mounting any of these things?) This lead to all sorts of instability in my measurements, so I eventually bit the bullet and just hot-glued the fucker. I don’t know if I’ll regret that when I want to reuse the accelerometer, but that’s a problem for future me.</p>

<p>Major success! I got the thing balancing!</p>

</video>
<p>After a bunch of troubleshooting, I realized that my power supply was completely fine. The motors would cut out when asked to spin too fast. Since these are boring DC motors, they operate via PWM — essentially, sending an oscillating square wave whose ratio of high-to-low duration allows you to effectively drive the motor at less than full speed. The problem I thought was the Arduino’s pins; perhaps there was a hardware flaw and they were unable to emit the same signal.</p>
<p>I split out the circuit and ran an LED on the signal (much easier to play with than spinning parts,) and I observed the same behavior there. Because there’s no way that a single LED is overloading my power supply, the issue must be somewhere else. I wrote a quick Arduino program to just modulate the LED at 100%, and, to my surprise, it worked just fine. Which means it’s thankfully not a hardware issue.</p>
<p>Returning to the self-balancing code, I realized the original author had multiplied an expected negative value by <code>-1</code>, rather than calling <code>abs</code>. In his code, it worked fine, but I had originally wired the motors backwards, and had mindlessly swapped the <code>DriveForward</code> and <code>DriveBackwards</code> calls. Works great, except that now the values were negative when the code didn’t expect them to be. So it would negate my values in an attempt to fix them, which resulted in asking the motors to spin at a <em>negative percentage!</em> Thus the weird behavior I was seeing yesterday.</p>
<p>Fixing the logic resulted in the excellent balancing you see in the video above — on my first try! Apparently yesterday’s careful calibration against a completely-broken implementation was more than good enough for a working one.</p>
<p>So, that’s the first step towards my skateboard goal. I’ve managed to put together (and mostly understand) a self-balancing robot. That’s the major hurdle. All that’s left is to change the form-factor into something more amenable to humans. Which means it’s time to focus on design.</p>
<p>After watching a few tutorials on FreeCAD, I figured I was ready to get started. Rather than diving into a skateboard, I thought I’d start on something easier. My alarm clock is currently some nixie tubes connected to a bare circuit board, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to make a proper enclosure. It’d be boxy, but have some interesting angles and holes.</p>
<p>Four hours later, I was yelling at FreeCAD for having the world’s worst UI. Conceptually I have a great mental model of how to build what I want, but the tool doesn’t make it easy. I think I have a working enclosure, so it’s currently printing. Tomorrow I’m going to take the Haskell-based <a href="http://www.implicitcad.org/">ImplicitCAD</a> for a spin, which seems like it will better play to my strengths.</p>
<p>All in all, I’m feeling great about the project today!</p>
<h3 id="section-4">2020-11-05</h3>
<p>I spent today traveling, so got less done than I’d hoped. But nevertheless, got a good two hours in looking at ImplicitCAD. As a library, I’m sure it’s excellent, but my god is it missing the everyday Haskell usability. ImplicitCAD suffers from the usual problem of mathematics — namely that there are no types and all numbers, regardless of purpose, are just the reals. Positions? Reals. Rotations? Reals. Curvatures? Reals. Worse, there is no indication of what the axes are. It was a frustrating experience, made more frustrating by the fact that I don’t really understand the domain I’m working in. I’m going to spend tomorrow also working with Implicit, as I think I’ve sussed out enough to be able to get some real work done. But if that doesn’t turn out to be the case, I’m going to cut my losses and use some other CAD tool.</p>
<h3 id="section-5">2020-01-06</h3>
<p>Today I gave ImplicitCAD another go, and made some solid progress on it. I learned that the default camera is facing the front of the object, and that the coordinate space is <code>(width, depth, height)</code>. After thinking very hard yesterday about how to construct the objects I wanted, I managed to put together a parametric version of the enclosure for my alarm clock, and the result is significantly easier to manipulate. I think I’m going to move forwards with ImplicitCAD as my modeling software.</p>
<p>Tomorrow all of the traveling should have died down, and I plan to get in a good session with my father, the king of batteries and building weird machines. It’ll be good to pick his brain on the feasibility of a full-sized skateboard, now that I’m reasonably confident this thing is doable.</p>
<h3 id="section-6">2020-01-07</h3>
<p>Spent the day discussing the project with my dad, who had some great ideas about how to go about actually manufacturing this thing. He also showed me some good places to look for parts, and we found some promising wheel/motor hubs. Furthermore, regenerative braking appears to be something I’ll get for free.</p>
<p>I also started CAD modeling the board. I’ve got its frame all modeled parametrically, so I can fill in real values when I get the real parts measured. I’m still missing the electronics and battery compartments on my model, but it’ll be easy to get that figured out tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="section-7">2020-01-08</h3>
<p>PANIC.</p>
<p>Today I spent a lot of time looking into what it would take to actually get this thing built in full size. I started looking at specific hub motors, and what sorts of power they’d require. After a few hours, I was panicking and physically unable to continue thinking about it.</p>
<p>Some problems.</p>
<p>First: I have no idea what I’m doing. The difficulty curve just of the theoretical engineering of this thing is already a significant challenge and learning experience. Physically manufacturing it is an even steeper one that I’m trying to tackle at the same time. The result is what feels like an impenetrable wall of understanding and difficulty, that I’m doubting my ability to overcome.</p>
<p>Second: economically, this thing is starting to look very expensive. Which is discouraging if I’m not convinced I can pull it all off. A few hundred bucks for the hub motor, the same again for the batteries, and then probably half as much again to have someone manufacture the chassis for me. Which feels like cheating, but which brings me to my next point:</p>
<p>Third: I don’t have access to any of the tools I’d need. I could buy them, but I don’t have the physical space required to store or use any of them, and this would dramatically increase my costs. No go. A maker space would be perfect, but there isn’t one in town.</p>
<p>Fourth: time pressure. I’m fully confident I could pull this all off in six months, given time to work out solutions to the earlier problems. Right now I’m further worried about shipping times; most of the pieces seem to be only sold from Chinese vendors, meaning a best case delivery of 10 days, but more likely closer to two weeks. That’s skirting the line pretty close if I were to order today, and I am in no state to be ordering today.</p>
<p>All in all, things are looking pretty grim. I’m not sure where to go from here, but I’ll sleep on it and hopefully things will look brighter tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="section-8">2020-01-09</h3>
<p>Slightly less panic. I asked around today on some local forums, and found the Victoria Tool Library, which rents out tools. That’s a big pillar of problems knocked down. All that’s left now is to find some space, and I’ll be happy committing financially to the project. I’m not convinced it’ll get done in November, but the deadline is just all make believe anyway. Not a lot done today, but maybe I’ll work out a bill of materials tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="section-9">2020-01-10</h3>
<p>I bit the bullet today, and bought a hub motor. It’s happening. Assuming shipping happens before the end of the month, I’m committed to making this thing happen. I also invested in a car share, which will make getting tools much easier than trying to heave a spot-welder around town on my bike. And I learned that there is a metal supply store in town that can cut things to whatever length I need, with no minimum order. It’s feeling possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65Tv4kycUSg&amp;list=PLiYCRuOFm1MNj5a5LCCYhqoHpRu8Sc1Fx">Youtube channel</a> of some guys building the same skateboard. Today I went through all of their videos, and that gave me a much more realistic idea of what’s necessary to do. I’ve decided to outsource building a battery pack, because it sounds like a great way to explode my apartment. With that and the metal cutting sorted out, I think everything should fit in my apartment.</p>
<p>We gucci, baby.</p>
<p>Home tomorrow, and I’ll start engineering exactly what the frame should look like, so I can get the parts cut as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="section-10">2020-01-11</h3>
<p>Travel day, so not much progress. I bought a motor controller, pilfered lots of great stuff from my dad’s workshop, and realized I already have the right gauge of wire to carry the wicked amount of current I’m going to need. Tomorrow I plan to sort out the design of the frame, and get that sent off for fabrication. I’m feeling good about the whole project.</p>
<h3 id="section-11">2020-01-12</h3>
<p>Recovery and errand day after traveling. Did some more part shopping, and figured out the WolframAlpha keyword for figuring out if my intended aluminum rails will bend with my bodyweight: “beam deflection.” Looks like they won’t, so I’m good. Tomorrow I’m going to suss out if anyone in town builds battery banks, and ask if any of my friends have a drill press they’re not using.</p>
<h3 id="section-12">2020-01-13/14</h3>
<p>No progress these days, just waiting for parts to come in.</p>
<h3 id="section-13">2020-01-18</h3>
<p>So the wheel hasn’t even shipped yet, and it’s coming from China. I’m going to put this project on hiatus until I get word it’s actually on its way. Updates when I have them!</p>

        <p>Wondering where I’ve been lately?</p>
<p>After almost a year of work, I’m <em>thrilled</em> to announce the completion my new book, <a href="https://algebradriven.design">Algebra-Driven Design</a>. It’s the culmination of two rewrites, and comes with a beautiful foreword written by John Hughes, the inventor of QuickCheck.</p>
<p>In the book, we take a fundamentally different approach to the software design process, focusing on deriving libraries from equations, algebraic manipulation and well-studied mathematical objects. The resulting code is guaranteed to be free of abstraction leaks, and in many cases, actually writes itself.</p>
<p>If that sounds like the sort of software you’d like to write, I’d highly encourage you to <a href="https://algebradriven.design">give it a read</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[
        <p>For my first two decades of life, I could never sleep. I’d go to bed at whatever time was my bedtime (maybe 9pm?) and lay restlessly in the dark for several hours every night until I finally got to sleep. I honestly had no idea that other people <em>didn’t</em> do that, that they got to sleep in an average of twenty minutes. I attribute a lot of my current mental acuity to this — that I had three hours of dedicated and mandatory <em>thinking time</em> every day for twenty years.</p>
<p>In retrospect, probably it was that can of Coke I habitually drank every dinner. It never felt like the caffeine affected me. Those endless nights of sleeplessness just felt like <em>the way it was.</em></p>
<p>I was reminded of this anecdote by a scary experience I had today. I ran into a guy who might have been my old coworker from halfway around the world, many years ago. We never worked together, but he had a distinctive face, and this guy had the same distinctive face.</p>
<p>He might have been my old coworker, but I’m not sure. I didn’t ask. Instead I got <em>the fear.</em> I got so fucking nervous about saying hi to this guy that I flinched away from the encounter, and am left to wonder about his identity forever. Or at least until tomorrow when I’ll probably run into him again at the same place.</p>
<p>These bouts of nerves — I used to get them all the time. But haven’t for the last four months or so. And my last four months have been overwhelmingly socially successful, most of which I attribute to higher-than-usual confidence. It’s the same nerves I used to associate with going over and talking to pretty girls. It’s the same nerves that I got before asking for a raise. It’s the same nerves I got while waiting in the queue at the bank.</p>
<p>Wait, what? Waiting at the bank? How is that nerve-racking? Good question. I’m not sure, but that was the first time I ever associated <em>my nervousness</em> with <em>all the damn caffeine I was drinking.</em> Not that I ever let that stop me from drinking coffee, but at least I was aware of it.</p>
<p>Today, nerves again, for the first time in months. And maybe it’s a coincidence, but I had just finished a strong coffee, after only eating soup for breakfast, after spending four months on an island with notoriously bad coffee, where the instant-variety is ubiquitous. I hadn’t stopped drinking coffee over the last few months, but maybe I’d accidentally stopped overdosing on caffeine?</p>
<p>I’ve been really grooving on being not-unbearably-nervous Sandy these last few months. It’s been a period of aggressive self-actualization; getting to a point where not only do I know I can take on the world, but I <em>feel it,</em> too. How silly would it be if my amazing change in personality was due to a fluke accident of stopping my socially-acceptable drug habit?</p>
<p>Now, granted, this is all conjecture, but it seems worth an experiment. So for the next two weeks, I’m going to consume zero caffeine, and see if I get any more of these nerves. I’ll keep track of my subjective confidence levels, and of my feelings of self-actualization.</p>
<p>On first glance, it feels like my productivity is going to suffer. “Of course caffeine makes me more productive!” Well known fact, that. <em>Everyone knows</em> caffeine makes you more productive. But I can think of more times I’ve been <em>way too caffeinated</em> and completely unable to work, than I can think of times I felt a profound performance improvement from taking a coffee (hangovers excluded.)</p>
<p>Last year I read a book on quitting smoking, even though I don’t and have never smoked. It made the interesting claim that over time, smoking lowers your default state, and having a cigarette brings you back to your old norm. The contrast is there; smoking does make you feel better and more productive, but only relative to your state of withdrawal. Relative to your non-smoking normal, it just brings you back to par. This feels very plausible for the case of coffee as well; I’ve heard much of the same comments from my friends who have stopped drinking it.</p>
<p>The great part is that I already have the infrastructure in place to measure my productivity. A little known secret of this website is that it <a href="https://sandymaguire.me/dailystats/">tracks my computer time <em>to the minute.</em></a> Which means that I have historical productivity data for the last few years, and so looking at trends during the next two weeks requires no extra effort on my part.</p>
<p>I’m writing this blog post mostly because I couldn’t sleep (related????) and figured I might as well do something productive instead of being uncomfortable in bed. I guess the takeaway here is to build lots of weird infrastructure just because it’s interesting. I never expected my daily tracking stuff to be <em>useful,</em> but having already done the legwork means that I’m now ready to carry out an <a href="https://sandymaguire.me/blog/time-compression/">exceptionally high value-of-information</a> experiment.</p>
<p>Oh, and also a reminder that our bodies are just meat machines that respond to chemical inputs just like any other automation does. This is a thing that I always seem to forget, and am constantly amazed when I remember it. Maybe writing it down will help. Hopefully.</p>
<p>You guys! We’re just <em>meat machines!</em> Maybe changing our personalities isn’t as easy as just drinking less coffee, but then again, <em>maybe it is.</em></p>

      <title>Resolutions for the Year</title>
      <id>blog/2020-goals/index.html</id>

      <content type="html">
        <![CDATA[
        <p>Seeing as it’s already(!) February, now is a bit late to be writing my new year’s resolutions. But late is better than never, so instead, we’ll just call them <em>resolutions for the year.</em> I’ve been putting this stuff off for six weeks now, so shoutouts to my new friend Katha for holding me accountable.</p>
<p>I’m half-way through a blog post on “excellence comes from qualitative changes, not quantitative ones,” and with that in mind, much of my focus for the next year will be to do things differently than I have been. It’s pretty clear that I could write more blog posts or read more books or live in more countries. But those things are playing to my strengths, rather than work on my weaknesses.</p>
<p>The big theme of 2020 is that it’s the year I turn 30! My <em>god</em> where has the time gone? Thankfully I don’t feel old, nor am I worried about an arbitrary number — but 30 feels like a good excuse to make some lifestyle changes. I’d like to spend a lot of this year focusing on having my life in a stable configuration for the upcoming decade.</p>
<p>Along those lines, I’ve divided my goals for 2020 into three categories — two focused on the future, and one for making sure I keep doing cool stuff in the here-and-now. Since we’re <em>already</em> here and now, let’s talk about that one first.</p>
<h2 id="output">Output</h2>
<p><strong>First</strong>, this year I will finish and publish my new book, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/designandinterpretation">Design and Interpretation of Haskell Programs</a>. This isn’t going to be challenging other than simply putting in the time, so I’m including it just to ensure it actually gets done.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, I am going to perform two hours worth of live music this year. I’m not sure if the format will be one big show, or lots of little ones, but I’ve got 11 months to figure that out. This is scary.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, and relatedly, I am going to compose 5 songs that I’m proud of. I don’t really know how to compose music, but I am excited to learn. It’s probably one of those practice-makes-perfect situations — hopefully.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I am going to learn a new programming language. I’m getting musty and curmudgeonly by only writing Haskell, so it’s time to branch out and learn something new. To avoid any weaseling, this has to be an <em>interesting</em> new language, so something along the lines of Prolog or Rust or Lisp, rather than Ruby or Go. The metric for success here is to have written a non-trivial, real-life, idiomatic program in the language.</p>
<p><strong>Fifth</strong>, I am going to finish all of the exercises on <a href="https://portswigger.net">Portswigger</a>, because they’re interesting and very outside of my skill-set of writing good Haskell programs.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong> for this pillar, I am going to read 10 <em>really excellent</em> books this year. Last year was a bit of a dearth on the reading front, and despite reading something like 60 books, I found it very hard to pick 5 good ones. I want to change that; there’s no point in reading a bunch of shit just for the sake of it.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<p>A change I’ve really wanted to make in my lifestyle has been to get healthy. I’ve never been particularly <em>unhealthy,</em> which has been my excuse for putting it off for so long. But my biggest fear is that I am only operating at 1/10th of my productive capability, and simply have no basis for comparison. Rather than continue to worry about that, I’m just going to spend a year throwing empiricism at it and see what shakes out.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, this year I am going to learn to love vegetables. Currently I don’t. I never have. People keep saying they’re good for me and I am going to die without them, but seeing as I haven’t ever died<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I haven’t really taken them at their word. BUT my god is this a ubiquitous one. At the very least, picking around the vegetables takes a big toll on my quality of life. So it’s time to face the fear, and learn to love vegetables. By the end of the year, I will be actively eating fruits and vegetables with every meal.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, I am not going to consume any alcohol in 2020. I’m already about two months in, and have been having a great time. But sometimes the urge comes back, and I need to beat it down into submission. Qualifying this as an explicit goal for my year will assuage the desire, I suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, I am going to do at least 150 minutes of exercise every week this year. That’s about 20 minutes a day, and is allegedly the bare minimum necessary to keep yourself fit and healthy. Seeing as I currently do about zero minutes of exercise a week, this seems like a drastic improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I am only going to watch high-value TV this year. Since I started tracking my youtube view-time, I’ve been disgusted with myself. There’s a lot of dumb bullshit I watch just because it’s there; I don’t find myself actively learning or feeling inspired by it, and I never feel like it was time well-spent. Any content that isn’t actively-educational to something I want to learn, or otherwise inspiring, will be forfeited. However, I will grant myself one movie a week, because media can be a social thing that I don’t necessarily want to miss out on.</p>
<h2 id="foundation">Foundation</h2>
<p>My final category of goals is of bigger, more meaningful stuff in my life that I think is missing.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, I am going to do consistent journaling this year. I will aim for at least five times a week, but not stress the actual numbers so long as it happens weekly. I find journaling helps me sort out my mind, but sometimes there just isn’t anything that actively needs to be sorted out!</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, I am going to volunteer my skills to a worthwhile organization this year. I don’t know who, exactly, but I’m sure almost every small non-profit has IT problems. And I’m good at IT.</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, I am going to make five <em>really good</em> friends this year. Over the last several years I have moved too often to really invest in tight friendships. While we do our best to stay in touch, it is often not particularly successful. But strong friendships are an important part of any nutritious breakfast, and I find myself lonely without them. So it’s time to put in the work, and make some really good friends. They don’t necessarily need to be new acquaintances — new friendships with old people is OK. My criteria for success is to see these people at least once a week, and to always come away from my interactions with them feeling powerful, inspired, and better about life than I did before.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, I’m really fucking tired of being on the move. By the end of this year, I am going to have found a place to settle down for a good portion of my 30s. Somewhere I’m allowed to live, with my own place, with a good and solid social network around me. This is the most important thing I’ve been missing for the last several years, and I am <em>aching</em> to get it resolved.</p>

      <title>Habits</title>
      <id>blog/habits/index.html</id>

        <![CDATA[
        <p>One of the things I learned last decade (<a href="/blog/2010s/">but forgot to mention</a>) is that actions are the only things that matter. Who you are inside simply doesn’t count if you never show it to people. This is an important realization — that true beliefs must guide action. Nobody in a mind-reader, and so nobody will never know what’s inside if you don’t show them.</p>
<p>Beliefs that are only inside you, by definition, are not out in the world, and thus can never influence the world. Action are what count — in fact, they’re all that count.</p>
<p>Before this week, when I thought of “habits”, I associated “thing that you consistently do”. But as I’ve been coming to realize, habits of “things you consistently do not do” are likely just as important, if not more. For example, late last year I was going through a machine learning course, and while I made it a habit of watching a lecture every day, I also made a habit of not actually trying any of it myself. The result: I have a high-level idea of how machine learning works, but I’ve never tried it, and the thought of getting started and <em>actually doing it</em> feels uncomfortable. My habit is now to learn about machine learning, but to not actually practice it.</p>
<p>Bad idea.</p>
<p>All we are is creatures of habits. In a very real sense, we are defined by the things we do habitually. And this is an important thing to recognize — that if we don’t nip small problem, they will quickly grow into traits that fundamentally weaken our character.</p>
<p>Dollar to donuts, I would guess that this idea of “negative habits” is why university is so much more successful at teaching than self-directed online classes. Having graded homework that you’re paying for is one hell of a motivator to get into the habit of applying what you learn.</p>
<p>Right now I’m studying computer security from a textbook. The nice part of a textbook is that you can work on it anywhere. After three days of study, I realized I had made terrific progress through the book, but, like in machine learning, hadn’t attempted any of the exercises for myself. Worse, the thought of doing an exercise already filled me with apprehension.</p>
<p>Another bad situation to be in. So I <a href="/blog/strength/">drew up some willpower</a>, then and there, to get started on one. Mustering the energy was hard, but learning this stuff is important to me — and it definitely wasn’t going to get easier to break the habit if I put this thing off again.</p>
<p>On a related note, I have recently identified a failure mechanism in myself. I just got out of a short, but fiery relationship. Within a month we went from having never met to living with one another in a foreign country where neither of us spoke the language, and spending literally all of our time together.</p>
<p>As you might expect, things exploded rather spectacularly, and I think a huge part of it was due to the fact that neither of us could practice the habits that define us. We were too crowded by one another to maintain ourselves. Without practicing our habits, we stop being ourselves in a very literal sense — after all, we are what we do.</p>
<p>I think this is an important thing to keep in mind when navigating a new relationship: the reason you like someone is the culmination of the things they do. As such, we should be very hesitant to disrupt that balance. Unless you’re impossibly compatible to begin with, introducing charge slowly (maybe imperceptibly) seem like a prudent move.</p>

      <title>What Did I Learn in the 2010s?</title>

        <![CDATA[
        <p>Not only is it a new year — and therefore a new me — but it’s also a <em>new decade.</em> Having been born in 1990, new decades for the world roughly correspond to new decades for me. I thought it would be interesting and nostalgic to look back at the last ten years to see what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>The most important thing I learned in the last decade was <strong>confidence.</strong> Interestingly, in my <a href="/blog/the-secret-of-happinesstm/">earliest blog post</a>, I give the advice to “trust yourself. I mean, really trust yourself.” Apparently I thought I was already confident — I wasn’t. In particular, I learned to be aware of <a href="/blog/double-dipping/">Dunning-Kruger</a>, and that <a href="/blog/brilliance/">most problems are effort-constrained</a>. I learned that there is nothing magical <a href="/blog/no-miracle-people/">separating me (or anyone else) from geniuses</a>. I learned to <a href="/blog/a-lesson-learned/">separate the person I am from the person I want to be</a>, and to focus on the latter. I learned about the <a href="/blog/neighborhoods">importance of knowing the people around you</a>, and of <a href="/blog/home-is-where-your-people-are/">having good social support structures in place</a>. Along those lines, I started being <a href="/blog/outside-view">very selective about the people I was spending time with</a>. I <a href="/blog/get-the-girl/">learned about dating</a>, and how to be attractive, and how to make moves — it turns out people aren’t mind readers, and if you don’t tell them you’re interested, they don’t know.</p>
<p>But in general, what I really learned here was to <a href="/blog/building-over-the-abyss/">stop being so <em>fucking scared</em></a> of <a href="/blog/comfort-zones/">everything all the time</a>. I learned to just go do things. Sometimes they’ll go poorly, but more often they’ll go well. And if you’re smart and trust in yourself to be able to handle the failures, well, that’s most of life right there. I learned about <a href="/blog/shame/">how I failed</a>, and to <a href="/blog/why-i-quit/">reflect on those things</a>, and to promise myself <a href="/blog/letter-to-myself/">to never do them again</a>. One particular tactic that came out of this new understanding is to <a href="/blog/new-city-guide/">always say “yes” to thing.</a></p>
<p>The second most important thing I learned over the last decade was <strong>strategy.</strong> I learned to <a href="/blog/affording-ascendancy/">build up momentum</a> in roughly the right direction, even if I wasn’t <a href="/blog/one-night-stands/">entirely sure</a> where I was <a href="/blog/showing-me-the-way/">intending to land</a>. I used this technique to <a href="/blog/book-mechanics/">systematically put together</a> an amazing CV, and arguably <a href="/blog/become-a-programmer/">an even more impressive set of skills</a>. I learned about the <a href="/blog/say-hi-to-lucy/">notion of career capital</a>, and <a href="/blog/book-mechanics/">accumulated enough of it</a> to turn it into a <a href="https://thinkingwithtypes.com">successful book</a>. I learned about the value of publicly <a href="/blog/book-mechanics/">committing to doing something that sounds hard and scary</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. After some talks at work that went <em>very badly,</em> I learned the importance of playing to your audience. Perhaps <em>most importantly</em>, I learned that I need <a href="/blog/looking-back-on-2018/">very specific goals and metrics</a> if I want to have <a href="/blog/2013-in-review/">successful years</a>.</p>
<p>The third most important thing I learned was how to get a sense of my <strong>limits and capabilities.</strong> I learned that that feeling of “omg I am <em>already</em> working at full capacity” is <a href="/blog/nanowrimo-postmortem/">usually wrong</a>, and that <a href="/blog/burnout/">real burnout</a> feels more like carrying physical weight. I successfully <a href="/blog/generalization-as-intelligence-amplification/">identified abstraction as being a worthwhile tool</a> to <a href="/blog/chunking-conceptual-legos/">study in its own regard</a>. I realized that Haskell is <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/archives/">the best vessel for exercising those abstraction muscles</a>. I learned to put <a href="/blog/first-20-recursive-bees/">my money where my mouth is</a> and to always be willing to bet on my beliefs. I further learned that this makes <em>everyone else</em> very very uncomfortable. I learned how to focus my zen, and how to be responsible for how I feel, and to not try and shirk it off onto other people. I learned a lot about my <a href="/blog/thrashing-wildly/">common</a> <a href="/blog/too-smart/">failure methods</a>. I realized the importance of having <a href="/blog/reclaim-your-attention/">uninterrupted attention</a>, and <a href="/blog/reflections-on-a-dumb-phone/">threw my phone into a large body of water</a> not once, but three times, during the last decade.</p>
<p>Fourth on the list of big things I made progress on is my <strong>sense of purpose.</strong> In the early days of the decade, I spent a <a href="/blog/along-for-the-ride/">lot of time</a> talking about <a href="/blog/not-for-its-own-sake/">saving the world</a> without knowing what that meant or what it would look like. I think I have made some good progress on this, and to be specific, I think that climate change and late-stage democracy are big problems that could be solved by a few smart, technical people working evening weekends. I intend to spend the next decade being one of those people. I learned to start <a href="/blog/building-over-the-abyss/">taking responsibility</a> for my failings, and <a href="/blog/shame">for problems around me.</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I learned to <a href="/blog/authority-and-momentum/">question authority</a>, and that <a href="/blog/where-uni-fails/">the people in charge</a> don’t <a href="/blog/teaching-badly">know any better than I do,</a></p>
<p>Finally, I made a lot of progress on my <strong>lifestyle.</strong> I learned that the traditional Western path is <a href="/blog/perpetual-motion/">definitely not</a> <a href="/blog/reaching-climbing/">for me.</a> I learned that I need <a href="/blog/no-possessions/">very little</a> to survive, and that realization has afforded me the ability to <a href="/blog/skaidre/">pack up and leave</a> whenever I <a href="/blog/best-place-to-live/">feel like it.</a> These days, my total worldly possessions weigh about 7kg. I’ve learned how to travel, and how to put myself in uncomfortable situations in which I need to YOLO my way out. Through lots of trial and error, I learned <a href="/blog/new-city-guide/">how to move to a new city</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to all of this, I learned lots of <em>things.</em> After all, I spent five years this decade in university, another five teaching myself Haskell, and one year <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/tags/polysemy.html">actively doing research</a>. As a programmer, I’m several orders of magnitude better than I was ten years ago. I’m also <a href="/blog/play-lots-of-music/">ten times a better musician</a>, much better at speaking French, and infinitely better at skateboarding, improv, electronics repair, building IKEA furniture, and miming in languages I don’t understand.</p>

<p>All in all, it’s been a great decade. I’m happy with how much progress I’ve made, but it’s clear that I need to get better faster if I want to tackle everything on the bucket list.</p>
<p>Thanks for staying with me over the last decade. Let’s strive, and collectively make the 2020s our best decade yet.</p>

        <h2 id="looking-back">Looking Back</h2>
<p>With 2019 so recently behind us, it seems like as good a time as any to reminisce. This is actually my second attempt at doing a yearly write-up; as it happens, the year of our lord 2019 wasn’t a particularly good one for me, and as a result, my first write-up came off aggressively negative.</p>
<p>But negativity feels like a poor way to start the new year, and thus, I’ve decided to focus only on the best parts of the last one.</p>
<p>2019 started off with a great deal of promise. Ariel, one of my best friends, came to ring in the new year with me. We spent our time jamming on Grateful Dead covers, doing the monster mash, and listening to Suavemente… over and over and over again — much to the dismay of poor roommate James. For new years eve, we rigged up my old Arduino-controlled light vest, and headed down to karaoke night. Starting off with so much music inspired my only resolution for the year — to <a href="/blog/play-lots-of-music/">play more music</a>.</p>
<p>Too soon Ariel needed to head home, and I found myself deep in a new romantic relationship with my roommate. I knew it was a bad idea. She knew it was a bad idea. Literally everyone told me it was a bad idea. But we didn’t let that stop us. Instead we leaned into it. Maybe it was too much Elvis Crespo, or maybe it was too much lovey-dovey roommate stuff, but we accidentally pushed James out of the house. He left without so much as a word to me, while I was traveling in San Francisco. Apparently he responded less well to the Suavemente than I thought!</p>
<p>I was in SF for business. The AI-safety non-profit MIRI and I were courting one another, and after a successful first few interviews, they invited me down to meet in person. Since I had spent a few years there in the past, I decided to take the opportunity to spend a week in my old stomping grounds — meeting up with old friends and taking in the scene.</p>
<p>While it was excellent to see everyone, I noticed something scary. Every single one of my friends was aggressively depressed. They all seemed to simultaneously hate living in SF, and be completely oblivious to this fact. Their vibe reminded me of <em>my</em> depression when I lived in the Bay, and sufficiently spooked me away from attending the MIRI interview. I was afraid if I went I would be tempted to take the job, and subsequently need to return to the Bay.</p>
<p>My good friends Fintan and Vikrem also came to SF to see me. We spent the week getting into lots of trouble, including (but not limited to) being literally kicked in the ass by a hobo, and witnessing a back-alleyway blowjob.</p>
<p>Vikrem is a man who is notoriously anti-SF, and upon my return, he deluged me with SF-is-shitty memes. One of them was a video about some guy who lives in a shitty SF apartment without enough space, and so needs to rig up stupid engineering projects to cope. I felt inspired by the video, and decided to do some DIY to spruce up my own place in Ottawa.</p>
<p>The result was some lights beneath my bed that simulated the northern lights. They would imperceptibly change colors and patterns, but always be colorful and always fill me with joy. I also did some redecorating, and commissioned a painting from my friend Anika. It helped make Ottawa feel a little more like home.</p>
<p>But Ottawa never truly felt like home. I had moved there on a whim in September of 2018, mostly due to the convenience of it. I was moving back to Canada, but there was no obvious place to be — my family and friends had all performed their own diasporas, and there was no critical mass of people I knew anywhere. Other than SF, which was a) in the wrong country, and b) not a place I was going to move to.</p>
<p>The lesson I learned from living in Denver is that if a city doesn’t feel like home, it’s probably because you aren’t working hard enough to meet people. So I went out, in Ottawa. I joined a pub trivia group, a choir, a jam group, an engineering space, an improv troupe, the functional programming meetup, two climbing gyms, among other activities. Most of these were delightful amounts of fun, but I never really met anyone I really connected with.</p>
<p>Instead, I started diving into my work. A few weeks previous, I had come across an academic paper that promised to solve some theoretical problems I’d been wrestling with for two years. It caught my attention, and after internalizing the approach, I immersed myself. For eight to ten hours a day, for roughly four months, taking no time off, I worked and researched and created. It felt good. It was the only intellectual exercise I found myself getting in Ottawa. The result was my <a href="https://github.com/isovector/polysemy">polysemy</a> project.</p>
<p>Somehow, I became aware of the Montreal functional programming group, and was invited by the very excellent <a href="http://gelisam.blogspot.com/">gelisam</a> to come and give a talk. My presentation was on the research I’d been so deep into the last few months, and this was the first time I was widely showing it to the world. The response was stellar — not only the feedback from the talk, but also just all of the super-cool people I met.</p>
<p>At some point, I bought an <a href="https://onewheel.com/">electric, one-wheel skateboard</a>. Cruising through Ottawa late at night on that thing, grooving out to surf-rock was one of the closest things to ecstasy I’ve ever experienced. I rode it out through one too many thunderstorms, and waterlogged the electronics. In an amazing fit of engineering prowess, I later managed to fix all of the destroyed electronics. The joy of riding around on <em>previously broken,</em> electric, one-wheel skateboard <em>that you’ve fixed yourself</em> is even more incredible than the original experience.</p>
<p>My now-ex had decided she too was leaving Ottawa, but not for six weeks. It didn’t seem fair to kick her out and make her find such a short-term lease, so we continued living together. We decided to make the best of a bad situation, that we should unite against the manchildren in the basement, and not bring anyone home (our rooms shared a thin, thin wall.) Over the weeks, we tentatively became friends again, and it was nice. The city felt a little less empty.</p>
<p>I started thinking about leaving Ottawa. Living there had been a solid attempt, but was clearly a failed experiment. Unfortunately the situation hadn’t changed — there was <em>still</em> nowhere obvious to move to. I had an inkling of an idea, to emulate Paul Erdos and spend the rest of my life surfing on excellent engineers’ couches. I dreamed of moving from city to city, spreading my knowledge, connecting like-minded people, and building cool things. So I put out a call for interested parties, and my god did they come. Before I knew it, I had two years’ worth of couches to stay on. That cemented the idea, and I started planning to sell my things and learn how to live out of a suitcase.</p>
<p>As a test run, I reached out to two people in Toronto — my old friend <a href="https://github.com/davidrusu">David Rusu</a>, and my soon-to-be new one, <a href="https://github.com/JonathanLorimer">Jonathan Lorimer</a>. The experience was stellar. Both men were <em>hungry to create,</em> just like I was. In the course of a week, I think I did about 60 hours of dedicated engineering work. It was everything I had been dreaming about for a year. I returned to Ottawa, my heart heavy to be coming back, and knew it was time to pull the plug.</p>
<p>My other cousin Charlotte had recently moved to town, and we found ourselves reconnecting over a forgotten-decades-ago appreciation for Jeopardy. In a very fortuitous state of affairs, Jeopardy history was in the middle of being made, so we hunkered down at the beginning, and spent weeks powering our way through.</p>
<p>In my last weeks in Ottawa, an old friend and I went out to hip-hop trivia. We crushed it, placing first. WE ARE THE BIGGIE PROFESSORS — more like Notorious PhD, am I right???</p>
<p>I left my skateboard with John, the coolest person I’d met in Ottawa, though unfortunately I’d met him only a month before. In that time, we spent something like twenty hours discussing philosophy and life and all sorts of deep, interesting stuff. Leaving the skateboard and leaving John were the hardest parts of leaving Ottawa, so it seemed poetic to leave them together.</p>
<p>My last day in Ottawa rapidly approached, and I found myself on a bus to Toronto, to meet back up with Jonathan. He graciously invited me to give a talk at the Toronto functional programming meetup, and I accepted. There I had my first taste of fame, where after my talk, <em>everyone just hung around,</em> casually listening to me talk. There was a gaggle of like 20 fanboys, sitting around to hear me ramble on without a shred of eloquence about GADTs and type-level programming. I felt famous, like the next coming of Ed Kmett. Then we went to the bar and everyone forgot about me and the universe went back to normal.</p>
<p>Somehow I ended up in Vancouver, to stay with my excellent, ex-coworker, Travis, and an equally excellent old-friend, Andrew. Being back in Vancouver was delightful, especially my munchkining discussions with Andrew, weird mathematical discussions with Reed, and a wistful fourteen hour catching up with Erin — a personal favorite human of mine.</p>
<p>My location rapidly converged upon my parents’. I spent a nice week with them, involving swimming, learning to make Caesars, an excellent painting lesson from my aunt, and a fun night at the local observatory. My dad’s health isn’t particularly good, so I decided to be around for his upcoming operation a few weeks later.</p>
<p>In the meantime I went to visit the awe-inspiring <a href="https://chrispenner.ca/">Chris Penner</a>. We had a great week together, culminating in an epic piano jam sesh. It was the first test of my year’s new music skills, and I came out from it very impressed with my newfound abilities.</p>
<p>The plan was to head south into the States, and spend a few months rail-tramping my way across the continent. But my inclination to stay in North America was rapidly fading, so I took my friend up on her invitation to come to Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Amsterdam was much less fun than I was expecting. We spent most of our time in the library, but I did meet an old friend from back home who is now the Amsterdam cheese girl. So that’s cool I guess! Also I did a lot of bicycling, and came away convinced that bike-only cities are the future.</p>
<p>I went off to Munich. While waiting for the train (it had hit someone, and was thus DELAYED), I met a fun woman from Leipzig. She told me stories of being an au pair, and of her paired child who, in cold blood, threatened to set her on fire. We had a great chat, and she invited me to come visit.</p>
<p>In Munich I stayed with the excellent <a href="https://dev.to/jvanbruegge">Jan van Bruegge</a>. He met me at the train station at midnight, and despite having never met before, we quickly became close friends. That night, getting comfortable on his couch, I was struck by the most amazing feeling — that my life is so incredible, to have such fantastic people willing to host me on their couches. I’ve never experienced such true gratitude before.</p>
<p>Thank you, from the very bottom of my heart, to <a href="http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/erdos/">everyone who hosted me this year</a> — thanks David, Jonathan, Boris, James, Travis, Chris, Andrew, Gintare, Jan, Soares, Justin, Anna, Andy, Asad and Vincent.</p>
<p>My travels took me all over. I went to Leipzig to meet that woman from the train, and to play harmonica, and to do cool category theory stuff with Soares — who graciously invited me to the Haskell eXchange. I headed back to Munich to build watering systems and fight Scala’s variance mechanism with Justin. I had a romantic little week with Elli. I met up with Matiej, my close collaborator in Bratislava, and with an old flame in Vienna. She’s since gotten <em>fit</em> and took me to the gym during my visit, during which time I was completely emasculated by just how much stronger she was than I! Her roommate Andy and I had an excellent daylong conversation about computers, and I met the mysterious spy woman Moni, whom I was relatively certain wanted to kill me.</p>
<p>But she didn’t. And so I went to London.</p>
<p>London and I have been flirting with one another for years. I’d considered moving there in 2018 for a woman, in 2019 it invited me <a href="/blog/gatekept/">to do a PhD</a>. Then the Haskell eXchange rang, and I couldn’t resist its siren call. It was a grand time.</p>
<p>But a <em>weird</em> time. I met a lot of people whom I then considered to be personal heroes. It was a rather underwhelming — one was a total dick, and another seemed like he was intentionally not understanding what I was trying to say. But besides that, the conference was a blast. I met the eminent <a href="https://richarde.dev/">Richard Eisenberg</a>, who knocked me off my feet with his overwhelming intelligence, thoughtfulness and kindness. Another personal favorite person of mine, <a href="https://github.com/judah">Judah Jacobson</a>, was there, and reconnecting with him was particularly joyful.</p>
<p>HsX had too many excellent people to iterate them all, but one other person who stood above the crowd was <a href="https://github.com/masaeedu">Asad Saeeduddin</a>. I’d met Asad briefly in Toronto a few months earlier, where we’d had an amazing conversation and he’d taught me a whirlwind of cool new stuff. My intended roommate had come down with the plague, and so I found myself homeless. Asad kindly let me stay with him, and we had a few great nights sharing music and doing old-school bro-ing out.</p>
<p>Also, I found myself as a minor celebrity at HsX! Several people had read my book, and went out of their ways to say nice things about it. One guy interrupted my conversation with someone else in order to have his book signed. It was an incredible pleasure to feel just how much people liked this thing I’d created. And the conversation I was in wasn’t particularly good, so there was no love lost on that front.</p>
<p>During the tail-end of the conference, I got extremely sick. Like, “oh god, this is probably the night I die”-extremely sick. Thanks to Asad, I didn’t, but it was too close a call for comfort. Though I didn’t realize it at the time, this was a symptom of too much traveling, too much work, simply too much everything.</p>
<p>A few months earlier, I’d applied for a job at Imperial College, after not getting in with my PhD program. They called me in for an interview while I was in London, and apparently I aced it, because (SO MANY WEEKS LATER) they offered me the job. I spent a few days hanging around Imperial, working with my amazing, would-be colleagues, <a href="https://kcsongor.github.io/">Csongor Kiss</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.wu">Nick Wu</a>. I can’t say enough good things about these two. At the end of the day, I decided that my mental health wasn’t good enough to sign a year-and-a-half contract with Imperial, and so, with many regrets, I passed on the job. It was hard, but definitely the right thing to do.</p>
<p>A week later, back in Munich, I was still trying to sort out my life plans. I had several “maybe we could do this” options on the table, but nobody on the other side seemed very keen on giving me a definite yes or no. In a move of desperation, I booked a ticket for Bangkok two days ahead of time. I needed a reminder that this was my life, and that I was in control of it. And what a better way to remember than to drop everything and head to a different continent with no plans other than “diving might be nice” and “I need a place to write this book.”</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I’d decided to write a book, and was actively working on it.</p>
<p>During my last trip to Thailand, I’d met a man who continually told me of how great Koh Lanta was. Since I didn’t have any other ideas, I finally took him up on that. Over the next six weeks, Koh Lanta became the closest place to home I’ve had in several years.</p>
<p>Not much happens on Koh Lanta. It’s one big island with one big road going all the way along it. I spent my days swimming, reading, writing, playing guitar, doing karaoke, and socializing at the hostel.</p>
<p>Because Koh Lanta is nestled in the middle of several BIG PARTY PLACES, it filters those people out of the equation. As a result, those who come to Koh Lanta turn out to be stellar humans on average. Some particularly great people I met were Heleen, Lily, Pavel, Jake, Ciara and Toby. Ciara and I spent a week traveling together, and she helped me realize just how burned out by programming I really was.</p>
<p>I decided to <a href="/blog/burnout/">take a clean break</a> from programming and from writing the book I was working on. At time of writing, I now haven’t touched any software for a month — the first break of its kind in 16 years. It feels <em>so fucking good.</em></p>
<p>My Thai visa was expiring, so I took a trip down to the Krabi Immigration office in order to convince them to grant me another week in this magnificent country. While bopping around Krabi Town, I met Natalia — the most scintillating, inspiring and fun person I’ve had the good fortune to encounter in years. The last few weeks of 2019 were spent with her, painting and playing music and skinny dipping and drinking mocktails and engaging in lots and lots and lots of amazing conversations.</p>
<p>All in all, 2019 wasn’t stellar, but got markedly better since I made the decision to come to Thailand. I’m feeling mentally and physically healthier than I have in a long, long time. It’s a powerful way to start the new year, and I’m ready to make the most of 2020.</p>
<h2 id="work-and-misc-metrics">Work and Misc Metrics</h2>
<p>I (and a robot on my account that I’m unable/unwilling to separate) made 3,137 commits to software projects in 2019. Some of the most impressive things were:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/merge_requests/668">GHC !668</a>: A patch to GHC that makes the simplifier work harder on higher-rank functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isovector/polysemy">polysemy</a>: My fast and easy effect system.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isovector/dynahaskell">dynahaskell</a>: A proof-of-concept editor for Haskell that writes most of your code for you.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isovector/suavemente">suavemente</a>: An applicative GUI that runs Haskell applications over websockets.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/isovector/hs-vexflow">hs-vexflow</a>: A DSL for generating sheet music in Haskell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I spent 567h in 2019 <em>doing work</em> on miscellaneous projects, of which 156h were spent directly on programming and doing research for polysemy. Another 46h went towards writing <a href="https://www.patreon.com/designandinterpretation">Design and Interpretation of Haskell Programs</a>.</p>
<p>In total, I published 32 blog posts, totaling 46,000 words.</p>
<p>Additionally, I sold 847 copies of <a href="https://thinkingwithtypes.com">Thinking with Types</a> this year.</p>
<p>Scarily, I spent 258h on the functional programming slack — which probably greatly contributed to my eventual burnout. That is a <em>lot</em> of time to spend thinking about Haskell.</p>
<p>Some other miscellaneous things I spent time doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>215h on facebook messenger</li>
<li>65h on email</li>
<li>48h recording music and learning music theory</li>
<li>40h on the phone</li>
<li>24h reading papers</li>
<li>15h preparing talks</li>
</ul>
<p>I spent 3185 hours on the computer in 2019. Yikes.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/14778474">65 books</a> in 2019, which is a little better than my 56 in 2018, and much better than my 15 in 2017. Unfortunately, the books this year were lower quality on average, and finding five favorites was rather challenging. Regardless, here are my top books of 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530415.The_Art_of_Doing_Science_and_Engineering">The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</a></em>: This is the most inspiring book I’ve read in a very long time. It’s Richard Hamming’s (of Hamming problems fame) self-proclaimed “manual of style.” TAoDSaE is a frank look at Hamming’s life, how he was successful, where he wasn’t, and commentary on how he should have done better. This is a refreshing style of autobiography, that’s chocked full of important advice on how to choose good problems, and how to have a meaningful career.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49634053-radical-markets">Radical Markets</a></em>: A book on interesting ways of applying more economic theory to everyday life. It makes strong arguments for better strategies of governance, taxation, and immigration that will plausibly lead to better allocation of global resources.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8205855-the-4-hour-workweek-expanded-and-updated">The 4 Hour Workweek</a></em>: Campy but good — a nice book on debugging your mind away from “I need to work a <em>job</em>” towards <em>I just need to make enough money.</em> Comes with lots of practical advice about how to actually go about doing this — though admittedly a lot of it is obsolete today in
<ol start="2020" type="1">
<li></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18930446-thinking-in-jazz">Thinking in Jazz</a></em>: My goal for 2019 was to get good at music, and so I picked up this hoping to get an idea of how people actually become jazz musicians. And amazingly, this book <em>delivered!</em> It’s a fascinating compilation of dozens of interviews with jazz musicians, coalescing the commonalities into “the way to think about jazz,” primarily using first-hand prose. I’d strongly recommend this book, even if you aren’t interested in learning to play jazz.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism">Digital Minimalism</a></em>: Cal Newport is back, making the claim that cellphones and social media are bad for us. He makes a good case. The reason I like this book is it confirms what I’ve been saying for years — being always connected <em>sucks.</em> Digital Minimalism offers a gentler path to kicking the habit than my recommendation of “throw your phone into the ocean. CMON! DO IT! STOP BEING AFRAID!” Somewhat amazingly, my approach has <em>never once</em> worked. Can you believe that?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>I didn’t listen to a lot of music from 2019 <em>in</em> 2019, with the notable exception of <strong>Sandy’s Official Banger of the Year:</strong> <a href="https://everyoneisdirty.bandcamp.com/">Everyone is Dirty</a>’s <a href="https://everyoneisdirty.bandcamp.com/track/hit-girl">Hit-Girl</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite newly-found artists of 2019 were:</p>
<ul>
<li>GDP</li>
<li>Mac Miller</li>
<li>New Monsoon</li>
<li>Nik Baertsch</li>
<li>Rhymefest</li>
<li>Strangefolk</li>
<li>Tennyson</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d like to take a second to shout-out Rhymefest, who has my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMz6aRwpHVM">favorite rap line of all time</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re dangerous but I’m game for this and I don’t kiss ’cause that could get cankerous white girls complaining the sun is cancerous pull my dick out and I done caused the damn eclipse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess that’s as good of a place as any to leave this post. Thanks to everyone who helped make 2019 as excellent as it was, and here’s to an even better 2020. Much love.</p>
